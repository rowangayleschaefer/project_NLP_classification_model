I'm using excel ODBC to connect to Database DB2

Clueless what this query is doing:

I understand self join is creating two temporary tables out of the same table.

In the above query, two temporary tables (with aliases a and b) created out of same table CUSTOMERS.  While ID and SALARY are retrieved from a, NAME from b.

I've built a MariaDB database to use with Power BI, however to make the visual I want, I need to create some generated columns. I'd rather not do it as a DAX measure and do it in the SQL database itself so I could utilise the column in any and all reporting.

&amp;#x200B;

Say I have a table structured like so:

    CREATE TABLE test (
    	id INT NOT NULL,
    	startdate date NOT null,
    	PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

Populated with this data:

    insert into test (id, startdate)
    values
    	(1, ""2022-04-20""),
    	(2, ""2022-04-21""),
    	(3, NULL);

Resulting in:

|id|startdate|
|:-|:-|
|1|2022-04-20|
|2|2022-04-21|
|3|NULL|

&amp;#x200B;

Then my question becomes, how can I add a generated column that determines if the startdate for each row is equal to today (not fussed if it's a boolean TRUE/FALSE or a varchar ""Yes""/""No"")

I understand this would then update anytime the database is changed/updated?

This is as far as I got:

    alter table test
    	add column istoday
    		generated always as (*IF STARTDATE = TODAY THEN TRUE*) stored:

Got majorly stuck at the IF placeholder part though.

26,emdw85,1646430283,False,"New to sql, but enjoying the ride. 

I would like to know how one would get info from Snowflake and then put that data into a SQlite table on your local machine.

Current Steps: 

Establish Snowflake connect and run query (currently storing in pandas df):

&amp;#x200B;

     import snowflake.connector
    
    
    def snowflake_connection(sql_query: str):
    
        conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
            user='USER',
            # password = PASSWORD,
            account='ACCOUNT',
            authenticator='externalbrowser'
        )
    
        cs = conn.cursor()
        try:
            cs.execute(sql_query)
            table = cs.fetch_pandas_all()
        finally:
            cs.close()
        conn.close()
    
        return table
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    
        sql_query = """"""SELECT.....""""""
    
        table = snowflake_connection(sql_query)

Step 2: 

Open Sqlite connection

    def create_connection(db_file):
        """"""Create db connection to SQlite db""""""
    
        conn = None
    
        try: 
            conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
            print(sqlite3.version)
        except Error as e:
            print(e)
        finally:
            if conn:
                conn.close()
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        create_connection(r""C:\Users\Name\sqlite\Regions_db\Region_1.db"")

I would import both of these [connection.py](https://connection.py)'s into a [main.py](https://main.py) file and run everything there. (I think that is best practice)

How should I get the data transferred? Is putting it in pandas then to csv then to sqlite the best way? 

Can I just go from one to the other?

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.   


Table: Employee

| Column Name | Type |

\+-------------------------------+

| salary                    | int |  
\+-------------------------------+  
id is the primary key of this table. Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee. 

My original solution was:

SELECT DISTINCT(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 

FROM Employee

ORDER BY salary 

DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;  


However, this was not accepted. Their reason was that if the table only contains one employee, then there is no such as second highest salary. One of their recommended solutions was to simply make this a temporary table:

SELECT (

SELECT DISTINCT(Salary)

There's a query I'm seeing that kiiiind of makes sense, but I want to make sure I'm understanding what it's doing under the hood.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, there's a table called teams, that has 14 distinct team names and a team id as a primary key. There is also a table called master\_plan that has a team column with the same names but repeated a bunch because there's \~64k entries.

The nested select in the following code is what's got me scratching my head:

&amp;#x200B;

    insert into plans(start, title, team_id, description)
    select
    	start_time_utc::timestamp,
    	title,
    	(select id from teams where name = csvs.master_plan.team),
    	description
    	from csvs.master_plan
    	where target = 'Enceladus' and title is not null;

is the nested select basically iterating through each row in the master\_plan and then using the smaller table called teams as a lookup table like in excel to pull the id? like literally going row by row by row by row etc etc. I get that its creating a column of the id, but I guess the logic has me somewhat confused.

&amp;#x200B;

If I switched it to:

    (select id from teams where csvs.master_plan.team = name)

I have a table listing two locations for two separate cinema locations. Looks like this:

    create table CinemaLocations (
    cinemaID int,
    cinemaName varchar(80) NOT NULL,
    cinemaAddress varchar(80) NOT NULL,
    cinemaEmail varchar(80),
    cinemaPhoneNumber bigint,
    primary key(cinemaID),
    )

with this data:

    insert into CinemaLocations
    (cinemaID,  cinemaName, cinemaAddress, cinemaEmail, cinemaPhoneNumber)
    values
    (1, 'Eye Candy Auckland', '40 Sun Street, Onehunga, Auckland', 'aucklandcinema@eyecandycinema.com', 901 234 5678),
    (2, 'Eye Candy Wellington', '25 Moon Place, Te Aro, Wellington', 'wellingtoncinema@eyecandycinema.com', 112 345 6789)

and a table for theatres per city cinema complex

    create table Theatres (
    theatreID int NOT NULL,
    theatreName varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    seatingCapacity int NOT NULL,
    soundSystem varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    primary key(theatreID),
    cinemaID int foreign key references CinemaLocations(cinemaID)
    )

each cinema location (2) has a number of theatres each, 6 for one cinema complex, and 4 for the second. I'm inserting theatre for the first cinema complex at the moment which currently looks like this:

    insert into Theatres 
    (theatreID, theatreName, seatingCapacity, soundSystem)
    values
    (1, 'Hades Theatre', 500, 'THX'),
    (2, 'Hermes Theatre', 325, 'Dolby Atmos'),
    (3, 'Ares Theatre', 325, 'Sony SDDS'),
    (4, 'Poseidon Theatre', 90, 'Sony SDDS'),
    (5, 'Zeus Theatre', 220, 'Dolby Digital EX'),
    (6, 'Aphrodite Theatre', 50, 'Dolby Atmos')

I only want this theatre table to be shown if CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 1 (for the auckland cinema)

I'm guessing I need to put-

    SELECT cinemaID FROM CinemaLocations where CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 1

\-somewhere but not sure where? Examples I've seen online seem to add the foreign key into the table as column data, but I only want this table to show when CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 1, so that I can have the same theatre table but with different data show when CinemaLocations.cinemaID = 2. So how do I make this table linked directly to a foreign key if its a certain value (being 1 in this case)?

Also, I've seen the JOIN command pop up here and there. Should I be adding that to get this to work?

53,bluesclues142,1647234786,False,"We have an app developer who wrote an API (PHP) to pull a bunch of data from our db (MS SQL). The job it is trying to achieve is pull current pricing, stock levels, and other stock info for a list of products in a cart. For each product, it calls two [ERP built-in] stored procedures, 1) to query stock levels and 2) to get the current pricing (pricing is a little complex in our ERP and depends on multiple factors).

The way the API currently functions:

    for each stock item in the cart:
        1. query the STOCK_LEVEL SP with parameter &lt;PRODUCT_ID&gt;
        2. query the CURRENT_PRICE SP with parameters &lt;PRODUCT_ID&gt;,&lt;QUANTITY&gt;
        3. query with a select statement: SELECT x from PRODUCTS where PRODUCT_ID = &lt;PRODUCT_ID&gt;

Obviously this API is quite inefficient - when the cart contains 100 products, it will literally send a SQL query for these 3 things 100 times. So I'm trying to think of how it can be more efficient.


In terms of query 3) I can see it can be improved by querying only one time before the for loop ""SELECT [relevant fields] from PRODUCTS where PRODUCT_ID in (PRODUCTS ARRAY)"".

What would be the best way to go about 1) and 2)? The SPs only take in one stock item as parameter. One way I am thinking is to write a wrapper SP, that takes in a list of stock items and executes SP 1) and 2) and puts results in a table, and can return this table to the API. Sure the SP will take ages to run since it is still running the SPs for each item one by one, but its at least an improvement by not sending each SP result one by one over the internet and should overall be faster and probably consume less bandwidth.

My question is, if this program is used across 10 companies and theyre assigned hundreds of tasks, what would be the most logical/most efficient way of querying the Tasks?

1) Where all tasks, both active and complete stay in the Tasks table, and they table grows large over time, and basically fills with all the tasks marked IsComplete = ""true""?

2) Or create two tables, something like Tasks_Active and Tasks_Complete. And when the task is complete, move the record from the Task_Active table to the Complete one. This seems like active task querying (which is likely what will be done most) would be faster this way?

Hello SQL Gurus,

I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post in but I'll give it a shot in any event.

I   have been prepping for the 1Z-071 Certification, on and off for the   last three months or so and have dedicated somewhere between 50-100   hours on getting ready for the exam.

Even   after passing the W3schools SQL quiz with 100%, achieving a silver   (almost on gold) badge on hackerrank and completing the basic and   intermediate SQL courses on datacamp, Using Kaplan's test engine and   some other resources that I purchased on Udemy and CBT nuggets (links to   the material below), I am still found wanting when it comes to exam   preparation for the test. I've achieved very low scores, ranging from   low 30's to mid 40's for the harder self-tests.

Coming   from a systems and pure networking background, this is my first foray   into SQL and I kind of feel that I've bit off more than I can chew.

Does   anyone have some suggestions on how to make the knowledge stick? I   don't simply want to pass the exam to get the certification (it's not   like I'll pass anyway at this point in time) but I actually want to   absorb the knowledge and be able to be a bit more fluid in building more   advanced queries.

Does it  require  some actual hands-on, practical work experience in order to  understand  the concepts better or is this exam just really hard?

PS:   I have a dummy DB and using the HR schema running on Oracle Express to   practice everything I learn, it just feels like I haven't had that  'aha'  moment yet and it really makes me concerned that I started a bit  too  late with learning programming languages.

I set myself a goal to learn SQL in a month, then it turned into two, and now it's turned into 3 months.

Did I set an incorrect expectation for myself?

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any sort of feedback to help me along my journey.

Cheers :)

I have two tables, ""subject"" and ""person"".

In the ""subject"" table, I have an id and a name for a specific subject.

In the ""person"" table, I have a name, a first name and and subjectID that is meant to be equal to a ""subject"" id

What I want to do with these tables is:

Displaying the number of people who linked to a subject. Therefore, I only want to get the name from ""subject"" and the count of subjectid from ""person"" associated to it. The problem is that I want to get it for all the subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

For example: 

name       | count

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Subject1 | 15 

Subject2 |  1

So I've been solving exercises here [https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT\_within\_SELECT\_Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial) and all went well until I stumbled upon exercises 7 and 8.

Table is simple, it just contains the names of all countries along with continent it's on, it's population and area.

Ask for the taks no 7 is:

&gt;**Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the** **continent, the** **name** **and the** **area:**

and their solution is:

    SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
      WHERE area &gt;= ALL
        (SELECT area FROM world y
            WHERE y.continent=x.continent
            AND area &gt; 0)

What I can't get is how exactly the subquery and ALL work.

I've seen examples of ALL in other tutorials and I seem to be understanding how it works, but I'm not sure here what the subquery returns, especially `WHERE y.continent=x.continent` doesn't make sense to me.

94,MasterQuay,1648106449,False,"Hello,

I have a problem at the moment where I want to insert only new records.  The major issue here is that I have no foreign key.  The schema is similar to:

    TaskId
    ClientId
    OrganisationId
    Reference
    StartDate
    DeadlineDate
    EndDate

This is my staging table.  My `dbo` table is exactly the same, except it also has a `TableId` which is a auto increment, unique identifier.

What I want to do:

* Insert new records only and keep old records

What I've tried so far:

* Concatting all of the values and trying a `INSERT INTO [dbo] SELECT FROM [stg] WHERE NOT IN (&lt;concatted values&gt; FROM [dbo])`

* `MERGE` doesn't work because I want to `MERGE` on a match as opposed to a non match.  I could put a dummy column in there for the `WHEN MATCHED` part of the clause to interact with, but I feel that's a little hacky and there must be a better way of inserting new records only.

* Joining the staging table to the `dbo` and then every time there is a `null` value for the `TableId`, insert that. (I'm going to try this today)

What I'd really like is the equivalent of the `pass` function in Python or any other language where the code simply does nothing although I'm not sure if that exists in SQL.

Just hoping to clarify a question I have on SELECT DISTINCT which I'm certain is really easy but I'm not 100% sure.

I've never worked in a job that's required SQL before but am interviewing for a data science position this week. **Need your help!**  


What I know of SQL is self-taught. I took Colt Steele's MySQL course on Udemy which took me up to probably an **intermediate level** and being able to do joins, aggregate functions, things like that.   


I'm now almost finished with an **Advanced SQL Server course**. It's been super interesting, learning things like CTEs, TempTables, Pivots etc. Definitely expanded my knowledge and understanding of what's possible with SQL. (for reference: [The Advanced SQL Server Masterclass For Data Analysis | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-server-masterclass-for-data-analysis/) )  


However for the job I'm applying for, they use something called Teradata, which I know nothing about and have no experience in. So I have **two questions:**

***1) How much of the material that I learned in the second course (can skim through course overview) for MS SQL Server will be transferable? Both in terms of concepts and syntax?***

***2) Where should I look next to get up to scratch with Teradata? Looking for specific courses and links to dedicated tutorials.***

How it is used:

 - Store every seen episode for the user in the  `member_episode` table.
 - Store one or more external site reference for a specific episode in `episode_externalsite` table.


On the `episode` table the `show_id, season, number` fields are unique, not really can change in the future. So I think maybe it is a good candidate for a composit primary key.
But in this case:
 - the other tables which have reference to an episode need to store all the 3 field from the episode table. Which can be a bottleneck if I wan't to scale to a X million user or episode. (more disk space, etc.)
 - on every join satement I have to check for all three fields


Quesiton: Which is more future proof or recommended method for the primary key in similar scenarios?
 - A: use a surrogate id field (like now)
 - B: use the three field composite for the primary key?

I have two tables **X** and **Y**. X contain attribute1, which is also a foreign key in Y. I'm interested in returning X.value1 and X.value2. A condition must be met, which is that the attribute Y.origin must be USA, Denmark or Canada.

`SELECT value1, value2`

`WHERE EXISTS(`

`SELECT *`

`FROM Y`

`WHERE X.attribute1 = Y.attribute1 AND`

&gt;! Acceptance Rate By Date!&lt;

&gt;!What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest.  Assume that each friend request starts by a user sending (i.e., user\_id\_sender) a friend request to another user (i.e., user\_id\_receiver) that's logged in the table with action = 'sent'. If the request is accepted, the table logs action = 'accepted'. If the request is not accepted, no record of action = 'accepted' is logged.!&lt;

I came up with solution nr.1 

    with sent as( 
    select CONCAT(user_id_sender,user_id_receiver) as request_id, date, count(action) as sent
    from fb_friend_requests
    where action = 'sent'
    group by 1
    order by date),
    accepted as (
    select CONCAT(user_id_sender,user_id_receiver) as request_id, count(action) as accepted
    from fb_friend_requests
    where action = 'accepted'
    group by 1
    )
    SELECT sent.date, sum(sent.sent), sum(accepted.accepted), sum(accepted.accepted)/sum(sent.sent)
    FROM sent left join accepted
    ON sent.request_id=accepted.request_id
    group by date;

However, I decided to make the code look neater and came up with the following solution nr2

    SELECT date, sum(accepted)/sum(sent) 
    FROM (
    select CONCAT(user_id_sender,user_id_receiver) as request_id, date, 
    count(case when action = 'sent' then action end) as sent, 
    count(case when action = 'accepted' then action end) as accepted
    from fb_friend_requests
    group by 1
    order by date) s

The records contain overlapping datasets and I am trying to merge/consolidate/collapse any overlapping date ranges to reflect a single overall range, partitioned or grouped by a few attributes.  I have tried using the tabibitosan method but didn't get accurate results in all cases.  Sometimes there is confusion when discussing overlapping ranges so to be clear, using [Interval Algebra](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alspaugh/cls/shr/allen.html), I am trying to consolidate all records that are essentially not having the relationship 'Precedes' (`p`) or 'Preceded by' (`P`).  
  
I found a [post with a query that looks promising](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/forums/topic/combine-overlapping-datetime-to-return-single-overlapping-range-record); however, I am having trouble understanding what this query does:  
  

	SELECT s1.StartDate,
	 MIN(t1.EndDate) AS EndDate
	FROM Overlapping s1
	INNER JOIN Overlapping t1 ON s1.StartDate &lt;= t1.EndDate
	 AND NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM Overlapping t2
	 WHERE t1.EndDate &gt;= t2.StartDate AND t1.EndDate &lt; t2.EndDate)
	WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM Overlapping s2
	 WHERE s1.StartDate &gt; s2.StartDate AND s1.StartDate &lt;= s2.EndDate)
	GROUP BY s1.StartDate
	ORDER BY s1.StartDate
```
  
Is this essentially saying:

    select the StartDate from s1
    and the minimum EndDate from t1 where:

       the t1 EndDate is &gt;= the s1 StartDate
       but the t1 EndDate not is &lt; EndDate 

      then i dont understand the final WHERE NOT EXISTS clause either.

Is there anyone can ELI5 each step of this operation so that hopefully I can learn what is happing and use this approach myself?

So if the first 5 tables have null values for a given ID, but table6 has a valid email, how do I get that in there? How I do write a SQL code that isn't a hideous mess of nested COALESCE functions?

I am working with Netezza SQL.

\- table\_2 has two date variables ""Date\_2"" and ""Date\_3"" that have variable types ""DATE""

\- All 3 dates have the same form : 2010-12-31

**Problem:** But this gives me the following error:

**What I tried so far:** I am trying to figure out how to make all DATE variables compatible so that the INNER JOIN works. I thought that maybe this can be done using the ALTER TABLE command:

    #create new date variable
    
     ALTER TABLE table_1 
    ADD COLUMN new_date DATE;  
    
    #set new date variable 
    
    UPDATE table_1;
     set new_date = date_1;  
    
     #repeat inner join with new date variable

    INNER JOIN table_2 b ON (( a.new_date BETWEEN b.date_2 AND b.date_3) AND a.id = b.id)

Hello, 

So, I am here to ask for guidance. I am 41 years old and do not have a college degree.

I have a lot of work experience and I excel in any position that I have been in. I have been offered 99% of the jobs that I have interviewed for. The problem I’m facing now is getting to the interview part. 

My husband is in the military, so we have moved around. It can get difficult to start over to a place where you know no one and have no connections. I’ve recently learned about SQL and coding jobs. People are able to work from home and make decent money. I just have no idea where to even start. What the correct way is to go about it? Many of the people that I’ve seen, don’t have college degrees but they take a course on SQL or something of the sorts. Granted, I did see these people on tik tok so I’m not sure how legitimate it is. But I want to learn. It’s the only thing that has made me feel somewhat hopeful in finding something. Before I met my husband, I worked my way up at my job. Then when we started moving, my pay is now a third of what I was making. We are about to move yet again, and I would like to have a job I can do from home so it doesn't impact us financially is such a detrimental way.

Any guidance would be GREATLY appreciated.",How do I get started in learning SQL?,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/spbz8d/how_do_i_get_started_in_learning_sql/,

82,jawlnal,1644516894,False,"Hello.  I am trying to understand what this query is doing so I can apply this to my own situation.  I have a table in my database [Oracle19c] with a bunch of records containing date ranges.  The records contain overlapping datasets and I am trying to merge/consolidate/collapse any overlapping date ranges to reflect a single overall range, partitioned or grouped by a few attributes.  I have tried using the tabibitosan method but didn't get accurate results in all cases.  Sometimes there is confusion when discussing overlapping ranges so to be clear, using [Interval Algebra](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alspaugh/cls/shr/allen.html), I am trying to consolidate all records that are essentially not having the relationship 'Precedes' (`p`) or 'Preceded by' (`P`).  
  
I found a [post with a query that looks promising](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/forums/topic/combine-overlapping-datetime-to-return-single-overlapping-range-record); however, I am having trouble understanding what this query does:  
  

	SELECT s1.StartDate,
	 MIN(t1.EndDate) AS EndDate
	FROM Overlapping s1
	INNER JOIN Overlapping t1 ON s1.StartDate &lt;= t1.EndDate
	 AND NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM Overlapping t2
	 WHERE t1.EndDate &gt;= t2.StartDate AND t1.EndDate &lt; t2.EndDate)
	WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM Overlapping s2
	 WHERE s1.StartDate &gt; s2.StartDate AND s1.StartDate &lt;= s2.EndDate)
	GROUP BY s1.StartDate
	ORDER BY s1.StartDate
```
  
Is this essentially saying:

    select the StartDate from s1
    and the minimum EndDate from t1 where:

       the t1 EndDate is &gt;= the s1 StartDate
       but the t1 EndDate not is &lt; EndDate

Long story short my company's governance is horrendous and it's virtually impossible to transfer anything off your work laptop. So I've been analysing the code by eye.

I understand it, and I've identified many tripwires in the data and the query that they're trying to catch me out with.

Also with ON statement does it make it so that anything you do to the attribute from table 1 (column1) affects the attribute from table 2 (column2) or does it just allow you to access attributes connected column1 and column2.

Hey I was trying to achieve this:

Join Query to join two table based on a common column and condition on another column that are similar.  
Here are the tables:

Wanted to append Swings column from T2 to T1 and return the T1.  
T1 and T2 are match by T1.Ticker and T2.SymbolDb, and condition being max(T2.time\_close) &lt; T1.TimeStamp. (meaning the I want T1.swing value where max value of T2.timeclose which is just less than T1.TimeStamp).

T2 table has thousands of rows.  
I had tried writing query but it returns thousands of rows of t1 . t1 ONLY HAS about 9 rows.

I am redesigning a database application of mine (personal side-project) based on what I've recently learned in a formal DBMS class. I've already made a number of changes that are clearly improvements over the previous schema. But I have one area that I'm struggling with, and hope I can get some help on.

The application tracks reference material for my hobby. A reference can be a book, a magazine article/feature, a set of film photos, a DVD/CD ROM full of photos, etc. Things like that. The problem is with books.

A `Reference` has the basic fields that all ref-types have in common: `id`, `name`, `language`, and timestamps. A `Book` has three additional properties: `isbn`, `publisher`, `series`, and `series_number`. (It also has a foreign key reference to the related `Reference` record.) Based on what I've recently learned, it would be wise to have the publisher be a separate entity with a FK reference to it in the `Book` entity. That would prevent the information on a publisher from being lost if the last book from that publisher is deleted.

However (and where the confusion comes in), while all books (theoretically) have a publisher, not all are a part of a series. So having the `series` and `series_number` in the `Book` schema would be wasteful. Plus, as far as `series` goes, having that in `Book` brings the same issue as having `publisher` in `Book`. So my design was to have `Book`, `Publisher`, and `Series` all be separate entities. I would use a FK relation to map `Publisher` to book and a relation table to map those books that are in a series to the relevant `Series` (the table records would both associate book to series and store the series number of the book).

BUT! A series is also linked to a specific publisher. I have more than one different series in my collection titled ""Aircraft in Detail"", and I have to know the publisher to distinguish them. So `Series` also needs a FK relation into `Publisher`. But now, the publisher information is redundant for a book; I can get it either directly through the FK on `Book`, or indirectly through the FK on `Series`. And this feels like a bad design smell.

What would be the most sensible way of approaching this? Given that a `Book` instance will only ever be linked to one `Publisher` and possibly one `Series`?",Joins vs. Extra Fields: Trying to avoid redundancy,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/rsb5es/joins_vs_extra_fields_trying_to_avoid_redundancy/,

I want to create sort of project or do something I can add to my portfolio to show potential recruiters I am somewhat familiar with SQL. I'm looking for something small, maybe something which would take max 5-6 hours. I'm a first year CS student so I thought I'd pick up SQL. Apart from what I listed, are there any other major things to learn in SQL. I plan on learning LEFT JOIN since I forgot to do so today.

I am also planning on using Pg as the db for a Python Flask Site I'm building. 

BTW, how do Python and SQL interact with each other if they do so at all? I'm familiar with Python so if I can build a SQL/Python based project that would be ideal.

If both tabA.colum1 and tabB.column1 contain 'somevalue', I want to use the record from tabA. Otherwise, it's a full join.

This is my query and the table that I got from my database, thats exactly what I wanted to get. Now my question is how do I do the same but for ""speed"" instead of ""size"". 

Exactly what I want my query to do is to list all DDR4 memory speeds (thats the Speed ​​data within the ""description"" column) from the table ""products"",  arranged in increasing order. And like query that I wrote before, the table should only have numbers of course, like 1,2,3 etc. 

Any and all tips are appreciated. Thanks in advance guys.",Need help modifying an SQLite query,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/rui6a7/need_help_modifying_an_sqlite_query/,

I am struggling to find when a certain company(or any) *fall 5% in value* within a window of say 5 days(row=day).

Basically i want to iterate on a window of 5days, take first and last value of each period and measure delta and check if larger than x%.

I know I can use  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING or something similar.

How can i do this ?

Longer explanation:

I want the max value of a column, based on the first two columns as id's and the sum of another column based on the same two id's.

I was thinking something simple as: ""select id_1, id_2, max(value_1), sum(value_2) from table group by 1,2"", however this gives me all id_1 and id_2 combinations, rather than just the max three rows shown in image (i.e. I get all 6 rows instead of 3 rows).

40,J_FizzX,1641857347,False,"For a while I have had the idea of setting up a personal local database for information regarding music that I enjoy and through that learn more about SQL and database management (Currently I only know basic query syntax). The idea would be to have tables such as the following:
----
table: tracks
----
id
track name/title
artist/composer
rating
genre
tags (containing a list of tags such as ""flow"", ""happy"", etc.)
----

I would want to be able to store and access this database locally. The main problem I am trying to solve for myself here is that I currently have names of about 3000 tracks of music I very much care about. They're all in a single markdown file and the issue I'm seeing is that I am mostly aware of music that I recently found and I often pass over older tracks (I still very much love them, I just can't remember what I associate with this many different tracks). With the database I want to be able to have a good backend that I can later throw all kinds of queries and/or visualizations on if I so desire (say, find all tracks I gave the tag ""happy"", the genre classical music and a rating of more than 4).

So in the end my objective is to both get a functional tool for me to use out of this (the database) and to improve my SQL skills in the process. The advantages of my current markdown file are that it is an open-source format, super-portable (i.e. I can simply copy paste it to a different system with a different OS and I know I will always be able to access it) and incredibly simple to handle and interact with (well, it's a markdown file..). With the database I would ideally want to conserve all these advantages, while giving me the power to quickly do queries as I mentioned above.

My questions to you would be:
- Do you have recommendations on which realization of the database I should choose? SQL Server, MySQL, etc. (keeping in mind I would want to ideally keep the functional advantages I mentioned above)
- Do you have any good educational material to suggest (videos, blog posts, etc.) to help me realize this idea?
- Do you have any other recommendations on the realization of this database? (for example the tag system - I'm not sure if a field with a list of tags is the best way to go about this)

Criticisms are welcome too of course! (Even if you think this whole idea is bs)

52,CitizenOfHopeNGlory,1642185652,False,"Hi everybody,

I am not sure if this is the best subreddit for this question, but I have to start somewhere. I am a total beginner and do not know the terminology, so please bear with me.

Part of my job involves keeping track of different dates and statuses for various assignments.

For example: I have to keep track of job X, that needs to be done by a certain date. Job X involves several steps, and I have to keep track of all the steps so that I know that all of them have been completed. Job X isn't finished until all of it is done.

Today I do this by going into one of the apps we use and then export the latest data as an Excel file (the only export option). I then go to work on the Excel file. My ""system"" today is that I assign different colors to different cells in the Excel file, so that I know where I am with the different steps (not done, doing, done). My system isn't exactly sophisticated, but it works fine until I have to do a new export from the app.

The challenge is that the data in our app is updated quite often throughout the quarter. Given that new rows and dates could be added at any time, without me noticing, I usually wait until the end of the quarter before I start to work on the stuff. That way I know that most of the data has been added and I can safely do the export and start to work on my spreadsheet.

If I could easily keep track of my statuses, and easily import new data without messing up my existing spreadsheet AND with me noticing any new data, I could get to work a lot earlier in the quarter and therefore live a lot less stressful life.

How can I improve my workflow?

The exported Excel file has a lot of useless information. All I think I need is this:

Job name - due date - step 1 (=DONE/DOING/NOT DONE) - step 2 (=DONE/DOING/NOT DONE) - step 3 (=DONE/DOING/NOT DONE)

(the steps aren't part of the export, but I have to do them before the due date so I would like them in my database)

The program we use has an API, so in the ideal world I could get daily exports from the program into a database that would let me add statuses for all the different steps. Can this be done by using a SQL database in combination with the API so that I don't have to use Excel anymore?

I am writing a dissertation on wealth distribution comparing BTC to the USD, and I am looking to create the below pictured chart for every single day bitcoin has existed.  I have extremely minimal SQL experience and no experience with any other coding languages. I was wondering if SQL would be the way to create a chart like this, and where I could learn how to code it. And then what program / language I could use to visualize it.

I have a website where I give customers the option to buy  monthly/yearly membership access to my products using either Stripe  credit/debit card payments or Btcpayserver cryptocurrency payments.  Stripe payments are recurring subscriptions unless the customer cancels  themselves while Btcpayserver cryptocurrency payments are not recurring  and the customer's membership access gets automatically converted to a  free membership with a daily cron job depending on the order date in the  Btcpayserver table when the customer made their cryptocurrency payment.

I need help designing the database tables where both credit/debit  card and cryptocurrency payments are supported along with the customer  membership access types (monthly/yearly).

The main problem I have right now is I am using multiple Stripe  tables with only 1 Btcpayserver table. Originally I had all the Stripe  tables working just for Stripe payments but then added on the  Btcpayserver table later and am not sure how to get them to work  together in a normalized fashion. Currently, when a cryptocurrency  payment is made, the UserMembership table membership column gets updated  to monthly/yearly while the Subscription table active column gets  updated to active (1).

I think I need to combine the Membership, UserMembership, and  Subscription tables to get them to work with both payment methods (and  also remove the Stripe related data from those tables) and then have 2  separate tables for Stripe and Btcpayserver related data only? I am open  to other ideas if this approach is wrong.

I would like the answer to this question to show a normalized  database with each table schema and columns written out with an  explanation of why this approach is the best way.",How to design database for multiple payment methods and memberships,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/r4ngjy/how_to_design_database_for_multiple_payment/,

But my database is a little more complex where instead of buying 1  off items, customers are buying monthly/yearly memberships to access  services on the website. Stripe payments are recurring subscriptions  while btcpayserver cryptocurrency payments are made only 1 time and are  not recurring subscriptions.

When a customer buys either a monthly/yearly membership, the  subscription table active column becomes 1 (true) and the UserMembership  membership column becomes either monthly/yearly depending on what  membership the customer buys. If a customer switches back and forth  between payment methods every month/year, new records are not added and  instead existing records will be updated with the new data for that  user.

The problem with my current setup is that when a cryptocurrency  payment is made, there will be NULL columns where Stripe API data goes  (Stripe customer id, Stripe subscription id, Stripe price id) or there  will be previous existing stripe data if the user makes a stripe payment  then a cryptocurrency payment.

All I want to know is how to best design this database, if any  additional tables should be created, and where to put some of the  columns so that there will be no NULL columns anywhere. I am open to a  complete redesign if necessary since the database is not in production  yet.

Should I make a separate stripe table containing all of the stripe  API ids? Should I only have 1 amount column in the Membership table and  not in the Stripe and Btcpayserver tables?

If I add more payment methods in the future, I want to be sure the database can handle that for this type of business model.

45,corporatecoder,1638972618,False,"Hi,

I have am trying to update a table (Table\_Acopy) every day with the new data rather than truncate/drop and reimporting the data through OpenQuery. The OpenQuery is the bottleneck.

Table\_A/Table\_Acopy have the following structure:

|Item#|Code|Value|...|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|11111|Color|Blue|...|
|11111|Length|4 inch|...|
|22222|Diameter|1 inch|...|

Since Table\_Acopy is a copy of a table from a different server, an efficient way to keep it up to date without a daily truncate and reimport could be to only delete and reimport the rows that have been recently changed. However, this requires each row to have a time stamp.

The problem is that this time stamp is in another table, let's call it Table\_B. Table\_B has the following structure:

|Item#|Code|Prev Value|LastChangeDate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|11111|Color|Red|12/08/2021|
|11111|Length|3 inch|12/08/2021|
|33333|Shape|spherical|12/07/2021|

My plan is:

1.) OpenQuery pull all data from Table\_B with a LastChangeDate &gt;= the last date I updated the tables (aka ran stored procedure).

2.) Use distinct Item#s from Table\_B (could be slightly more efficient and also use the Codes along with Item#, but this is least of my worries) and delete all rows in Table\_Acopy with these Item#s.

3.) **This step is the problem.** OpenQuery all the rows with just those distinct Item#s used in Step 2 and add these to the Table\_Acopy with a FULL OUTER JOIN.

I do not know how to dynamically find all the rows from a table with a value in a list through OpenQuery. I know how to dynamically use LastSPRunDate to only pull the new data in OpenQuery, but not with a list. Below is my attempt:

    DROP TABLE Table_Bcopy
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sysobjects WHERE name='Table_Bcopy' and xtype='U')
    	CREATE TABLE Table_Bcopy(
                Item# varchar(5)
            )
    
    INSERT INTO Table_Bcopy(Item#)
    VALUES ('11111'),
    		('11111'),
    		('33333')
    
    
    --DECLARE @TestList varchar(10)
    --SET @TestList = (SELECT DISTINCT Item# FROM Table_Bcopy)
    --PRINT(@TestList)
    
    
    DECLARE @TSQL varchar(8000)
    
    SET @TSQL = 'SELECT *
                FROM OPENQUERY(ServerName,''SELECT * FROM DataBase.Table_A
    			                           WHERE Item# in ' + (SELECT DISTINCT Item# FROM Table_Bcopy) + ''')'
    EXEC(@TSQL)

\*Note: Table\_Bcopy is just the newly changed rows, not the entire Table\_B.

\*Other Note: The server is an AS/400

I think ""(SELECT DISTINCT Item# FROM Table\_Bcopy)"" is the problem, but I don't know what to do instead. The error I keep getting is ""Subquery returned more than 1 value. This is not permitted when the subquery follows =, !=, &lt;, &lt;= , &gt;, &gt;= or when the subquery is used as an expression.""

I've been working my way through a SQL course on Udemy (The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go From Zero to Hero) and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I feel like for the first half of the course I was retaining a ton, but as new topics have continued, I'm struggling to retain them simply due to not being able to practice as much since we've stopped using a larger practice database.

Reviewing the code, I was reminded that I had coded special generic getter/setter methods for the classes that Sequelize creates that handle NULL values in string fields specially; a NULL is coerced into a zero-length string on a get and an empty string is coerced back into NULL on set.

BUT... I recall having discussed this issue a year or more ago on a different sub (which I've forgotten), and having been told that this is really not the best way to do this, from a general RDBMS and SQL perspective.

newbie here and I'm working my way through The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla on Udemy.

I'm confused as to how to go about adding or dropping a foreign key constraint on an already existing table for a single column. In the lecture he uses SET and DROP, with ALTER TABLE but then also briefly mentions ADD CONSTRAINT but doesn't differentiate when to use which one.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I have 3 tables. One called teachers, one called students, and I tried making a third called stu\_tea that just combines Teacher\_id from teachers, and student\_id from students. Obviously I could have done the foreign key stuff initially when creating stu\_tea, but I wanted to see how it could be done after the fact.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't for the life of me figure out how to DROP the foreign key part.

&amp;#x200B;

To add one I got the following to work: 

    ALTER TABLE stu_tea
    ADD FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id)
    REFERENCES teachers(teacher_id);

but how would I drop that same constraint? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried googling it, and only ended up more confused after trying every possible syntax I could find.

Let say that I have different ""Subjects"" - ""cars"" for example. In that car subject, I have ""topics"" like ""breaks"", ""engine"", ""fluids"" etc. And every topic has some questions and answers to them. Currently a questions ""belongs to"" a topic, and a topic belongs to subject. I have done this with a extra id column. ""topic_id"", ""subject_id"". This works, but what if I want to have the same question in two different topics, this leaves me with no other choice than to have duplicate questions. And if all data would be static forever that won't be a problem, but it will be a problem if I have to moderate duplicate questions over several different topics.

The same goes for images that relates to either a Subject, topic or a question. It would be smoother not to have an `image` colum on every table.

**Problem**: I can't seem to manage the null values. Either (a) I get an invalid input syntax error, (b) I can alter the debit and credit columns to be VARCHAR datatypes, but then I have my debits and credits as a bunch of strings that I can't do math with.

See below for specifics:

I've searched all over Google, Reddit, stackexchange, but cannot seem to find a solution to this problem.

1. I've set up a table in pgadmin via the following query:

	bank\_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

	bank\_account VARCHAR(25),

	trans\_date TIMESTAMP,

	post\_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,

	check\_no SMALLINT,

	bank\_description VARCHAR(50),

	bank\_debit NUMERIC,

	bank\_credit NUMERIC

)

2. I've downloaded the CSV file from my bank that has my transactions from the previous month and corresponds identically to the columns above (except for bank\_id). 

3. In the CSV file, there are no values in the ""check\_no"" column because this only gets a value when I write a check, and I don't do that a ton. Also, there will ONLY be a value in either the ""bank\_debit"" or the ""bank\_credit"" column, but never both. So in any given row, either the bank\_debit column or the bank\_credit column will be blank.

4. When I import the CSV file, I get this error:  

1. ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type smallint: """"

5. I tried googling the answer. This site [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282154/importing-csv-file-with-null-values-into-phpmyadmin](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282154/importing-csv-file-with-null-values-into-phpmyadmin) and a few others seem to suggest setting the Null Strings option in pgadmin to NULL.

6. So I did that and got this error:  

1. ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type smallint: """"

7. Okay, so let me alter the table. I'll set the check\_no, bank\_debit, and bank\_credit to VARCHAR(50).

I figured it out the solution but i still don't get why it gives me the correct output. for example this query:

    SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SALARY &lt;
    (SELECT MAX(SALARY)FROM EMPLOYEES) 

gives me the value of the second highest salary.

but if i write the above query like this:

    SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SALARY&lt;
    (SELECT MAX(SALARY)FROM EMPLOYEES)
    GROUP BY SALARY

gives me the value I'd expected when writing the query. what I'm trying to say(and my bad english doesn't help me in doing that) is why the first query only gives me the right value (17000) for my db

and the second one doesn't? the second one lists me all salaries that are &lt;of the max and the difference is just a group by between the two queries.

what I know is this: they are subquery so the query written in the parenthesis executes first.

so in the first case i have the max salary (24000) then I select the max salary again. so it would be something like:

    WHERE 24000&lt;24000

and this gives me the second highest salary,even if I don't really get how,with what logic. I mean I wouldn't expect that output. I would expect nothing to return. in the second case then why with a group by in the end gives me also the values that were in the first query thrown away?

I know this may sound a stupid question but I'm a beginner in SQL and this have seemed to me a little bit strange. it seems like having the SELECT(MAX) in the parent query does an implicit groupby

I am dealing with financial data and FX pairs from the European Central Bank do not get broadcast on weekends and holidays. For this small subset of days, I want to select the conversion price from the nearest previous day (with a max of 4 days separating the open times).

My goal is to convert into USD so I can get USD volume. I have joined on days that match no problem in one of my subqueries and have a current subquery that only has the rows that did not have a match called 

&gt;seperated\_sales

I tried doing this to bring in the data to my subquery:  


    SELECT ss.open_time,
       ss.base_symbol,
       ss.quote_symbol,
       ss.volume,
       (SELECT conversion FROM fiat_price WHERE base_symbol = ss.quote_symbol
        AND open_time &lt; ss.open_time LIMIT 1) AS conversion
FROM seperated_sales ss

&gt;This type of correlated subquery pattern is not supported due to internal error

I get the error above. I am trying to think about a better way to do this as even my solution does not have a cut off in the difference between the open times.   


I tried to do something similar like:

    WHERE base_symbol = ss.quote_symbol AND MIN(DATEDIFF(day, open_time, ss.open_time)) &lt; 4

I know the data I'm looking for but I'm having a hard time creating a query of any kind to produce the results I need. This ERP system is designed to be able to create work orders and then link child work orders off of it. 

When you do this, the child work orders are scheduled in a fashion to meet the requested ""Want Date"" of the parent work order. Because of the way the scheduling system works in this ERP, that ""Want Date"" field is not carried over to the child work orders. I need that date to calculate a DATEDIFF for material requirements on those child work orders. So, I know the information I need, just having trouble getting it to populate into the row results with any kind of join or other things I've tried. 

Example: 

Note: SUB\_ID 0 (zero) equals the Parent Work Order. A SUB\_ID of anything 1 or greater is a child work order that is linked to the parent.

DESIRED\_WANT\_DATE in the bottom three rows is not an available field in those child work orders so they populate as NULL. Is there anyway I can copy the parent work orders DESIRED\_WANT\_DATE into the NULL values of the child work orders for the query results? Keep in mind this example is looking at a single WO just for testing the query. The final result will be pulling out much more information than what's shown and include many more work orders. 

In the query results shown, DESIRED\_WANT\_DATE is from one table while all other columns are from the same 2nd table. The results are using an INNER JOIN on the BASE\_ID and SUB\_ID as those columns reside in both tables.   


The ""DAYS EARLY/LATE""  column (2nd to last) is a calculated column using DATEDIFF. FINISH\_DATE is determined by the system based on when the material requirement will be made available. This information is calculated from various sources (purchase orders, other work orders, etc). My goal is to take the FINISH\_DATE minus DESIRED\_WANT\_DATE to get a number. Anything negative would represent a material that is expected to be late and we can then sort the results to prioritize remedying the materials causing the most negative impact.",Defining certain row information based on other defined criteria,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/qpt79p/defining_certain_row_information_based_on_other/,

49,Zomics,1636754129,False,"I've been a software developer for a couple of years now but I'm just starting out in the world of databases and SQL. I'll start off by saying that I'm working with Postgres to give context. I currently work at a small tech company and started to create a small prototype project that we hope grows into a larger product for us. I'm tasked with creating a simple database for some customer data stored in tabled reports.  I've spent the last few weeks learning about standard practices for SQL databases and creating a schema for the data that we wish to import. I've now started looking at how to translate that schema into an actual database of tables.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started looking into doing this I created simple test tables inside of pgadmin on our server to test out writing queries and doing some simple SELECT and INSERT operations using C#. When I was doing this I came across documentation and tutorials that would create tables in this manner.

    CREATE TABLE distributors (
        did     integer,
        name    varchar(40),
        PRIMARY KEY(did)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE distributors (
        did     integer PRIMARY KEY,
        name    varchar(40)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE contacts(
       contact_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
       customer_id INT,
       contact_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       phone VARCHAR(15),
       email VARCHAR(100),
       PRIMARY KEY(contact_id),
       CONSTRAINT fk_customer
          FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) 
    	  REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
    );

It essentially sets up a table all at once. Constraints, keys and all in one query. This is a how I created these test tables by running individual table queries inside of pgadmin one at a time. I found typing out each of these queries to be cumbersome and time consuming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then looked for examples on how to translate a schema to a new database. I stumbled across this [GitHub](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema) for [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema). It illustrates the whole schema and shows you the scripts they use. I noticed they use individual SQL scripts that have one single job across all tables in the schema breaking it down into fine parts. Creating tables, dropping tables, creating constraints, keys etc. I've noticed others doing this as well while browsing around. I imagine this makes setting up backup databases much easier but also if you need to make changes to a current database schema you could quickly change individual components such as primary keys in a table very easy as you can make a quick change and then set up a new database with the new schema. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question comes down to why was this initially set up this way in the MusicBrainz project and whether this is a common practice? Are there other ways of breaking down a schema and writing SQL scripts to quickly import a schema into a database?",Standard practices for writing SQL scripts that import a schema.,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/qslvzk/standard_practices_for_writing_sql_scripts_that/,

E.g. if an employee works at the Chicago store in week 2021-51 - since there is no previous data they are considered “new” or newly joined. If this same employee also works on 2021-52, they are considered “old”. If the employee takes a one week break, and then re-joins the same store, they are considered “new” once again, as it’s only vs. last week.

The aggregation should be done at store level, since each store is independent/separate.

I'm new to SQL and just wondering how I would go about structuring a PostgreSQL database where a portfolio table can have many assets of many different types, and each asset can have many transactions but where all asset types use the same transaction type.

My current approach is: Using an intermediary table called asset which is connected one to many to the portfolio table, then has one to one connections to each of the asset types (share, fund...) which actually store the data, and also has a one to many connection with transactions. This technically works but is a bit annoying as whenever I want to get the transactions for a share for example, I have to go up to the parent asset then back down to its many transactions. I had a quick look at foreign keys to multiple tables but my searching didn't seem to yield the results I was looking for.

Is there a simple way that I could implement this?

I asked a similar question two days ago, but after trying to find out how to do what I wanted to do for about three hours yesterday, I stopped and decided to ask for help, because I really don't know why it doesn't work.  


I am trying to join two tables using a bridge table, which is working fine for the most part. I have my first table, containing meals (table gericht), and their ID, then I have my second table (table allergen), containing allergens and their code. Now I have my bridge table (table  gericht\_hat\_allergen gha), containing meal IDs and allergen codes.  


Not all meals from gericht have allergens, and not all allergens from allergen are used  


When I want to join the tables to simply display every meal that has any allergens and the corresponding allergens, it's working great. Same goes for selecting every meal, even those who don't have any allergens, and the reverse, so showing the full list of allergens and the meals that have allergens.  


Now, I want to join my tables in a way that allows me to see ALL meals and ALL allergens, even if they don't have any 'partners', so, like this  


meal1 | allergen 4  
&lt;NULL&gt; | allergen 5  
meal3 | &lt;NULL&gt;  


For that, I was trying to use full joins. I thought this would work:  


SELECT gericht.id as gericht, allergen.name as allergen  
FROM gericht\_hat\_allergen gha

INNER JOIN gericht  
 ON gha.gericht\_id = gericht.id  
 FULL JOIN allergen  
 ON gha.code = allergen.code  
ORDER BY [gericht.id](https://gericht.id);  


However, PHPStorm (which I am using) says that it can't resolve 'allergen' in the first row, and I don't know why. I have already tried reading up on full joins, but to no avail.

I started doing IT for a company about a year ago, and the guy before me made an app for them, but did not leave me with any way to alter the app. It's used to allow incoming delivery drivers to fill out a sheet and post it in a place that the warehouse workers can see, and it all connects to a SQL database. It works fine, but from what the last guy told me, he's using a string for the date section.

6,AsleepConcentrate2,1632844956,False,"Some background: my organization did a survey regarding people’s travel patterns. We’re trying to code responses into a standardized format for further analysis. 

The way the survey output was generated is as follows: let’s say someone indicated that they needed to travel for school. They ticked a checkbox on the survey; in the output, there’s a column (let’s call it SchoolTrip) with a value of 0 if it was left blank, and 1 if it was checked. 

What I’d like to do is evaluate each of those columns to see if they were checked or not (so 1 or 0), and if it was checked, to then pull a trip type code from another table with the codes for all the trip types. 

In this example, a school trip has a key of 2 and a code (in a column called TripCode) of T2. So I’d like my query to return each record in the master data table plus a new column that shows the trip code (assuming the value for SchoolTrip was 1).

i need to calculate the average, max and minimum cost of rooms in the hotels, i have the rooms in a count statement to count how many room are in each hotel, but when i am selecting the tariff (price) im not sure how to do it for each one individually, without writing separate statements for each hotel.. there must be a way? this is my current statement, if anyone can help id really appreciate it!

31,ilikethemaymays,1633625879,False,"New SQL learner here. So earlier this week I decided to finally learn a language - no excuses.

Now I've had my own issues in the past with free coding courses because it's difficult for me to feel as though I'm actually learning anything and it becomes discouraging. Most of them hold your hand through the course and give you brownie points for pecking in commands without much explanation of how it plays into a larger picture, or how to organize the idea before anything is typed. 

Some are merely ""Now type this into the field"" ...*clickity clackity-clack*... ""Yay! Now you're Level 3207! Check in tomorrow for the Platinum badge!"", and I'm left wondering what the heck I actually did. [insert young Michael Scott shaking Ed Truck's hand meme] Sometimes I'm a few days deep into a course and I start wondering, ""Should I have been writing all of this down?"" It feels as though there's no real direction.

That has just been my experience in the past and it started to occur again when learning SQL through some free online courses. So I figured maybe I'm the type of person who needs extra resources instead of relying solely on an online course to learn.

Yesterday I bought some e-books to supplement the knowledge to better understand the language including SQL All-In-One For Dummies.

The Dummies book has a chapter titled ""Modeling a System"" which explains in thorough detail how to visually organize your database, before any code is actually performed, through the use of Entity-Relationship diagrams as well as explaining the relational database hierarchy.

Friggin yes - this is what I needed all along - *a structure for putting together the idea for what is to be created and how to organize it before I even begin to clickity clackity.* The chapter gave me the confidence I needed for the online courses because I now understand how the arbitrary commands can relate into a larger idea.

This isn't to knock free code courses either. Just the fact I needed more than that to get a firm grasp on SQL. And it's the first language I can say I'm actually excited learning more about it since spending time studying the chapter.

* Learn the basics to **SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**
* Write complex SQL syntax
* Create Databases and inserting thousands of values
* Analyze thousands of rows of data – real world healthcare data
* Prepare data for visualizations such as PowerBI, Tableau, etc.
* Design Entity Relationship Diagrams
* Aggregate, format, and modify data using SQL operators and functions
* Gain experience with **Big Data** and solving complex questions using data

I'm new to SQL (new to all programming) and couldn't find an easy solution for a problem I have at work. So I was wondering if there is any simple way to pull this kind of thing off. Skip to the TL;DR if you don't want a description of my workplace. :-)

So I work at a sawmill. In the production line there's a measuring device which uses laser technology to 3D measure every single log that passes before it's sawn into planks. The system measures its length, diameter and possible deformation (basically if it's crooked). Then, after it's sawn into planks, there's a device for automatic measuring of the planks and their properties. We are looking into hiring the manufacturer of these devices so that they would build a feature where these meters automatically save the data into an SQL database for every single log and every single plank that comes out of them. 

So here's when I come in. Apparently the two meters would build their own tables of data, and I am to join these tables together in order to get the data I want out of it, and compare the data: what were the planks like from a specific type of log. My problem is, I would have to be able to join the information of the plank with the information of the log it was sawn out of. There are a few variables in this. Let's say it's 4 planks that are sawn from the log. So the data the plank meter puts out would have 4 records for every 1 record from the log table. Also if there are problems with the sawline or a malfunction, maybe even a power outage, the order may get mixed up: so basically the order of logs (log 1, 2, 3, 4) doesn't always correspond with the order of planks (plank 1, 2, 3, 4 having been sawn from log 1 for example). This line of numbers may get mixed up because of an error.

So, we thought, since the length of the logs is an identifiable unique value that stays the same after it's sawn, maybe the tables could be joined together looking at the length value that the meters put out. Problem is, they're not always the exact same between tables either, since the meters are not always exact to the millimeter.

So tl;dr: I would have to be able to join together two tables of information on two requisites: that the running number value is the closest possible, and the length would have to correspond as well, perhaps to be the same within 20 millimetres or so.

Is this possible using MySQL? Or is this issue far too complicated?

The tables would perhaps look like this, and in this example there's two planks per log, left being the table for log information, and right being for planks:

In '5001718' and '5001720', there are two status, which are 'Good Debt' and 'Bad Debt'. I want to delete 'Bad Debt' since it has least values.

Similarly, if 'Good Debt' has least total compared to 'Bad Debt', then the 'Good Debt' will be deleted. What function do I need to use in SQL? Since I'm a bit blur what the code will be look like.

*All the columns are coming from single table*.

I'm working on evaluation of a new teaching method at a college.  We are collecting student demographics and academic data from the university each semester and we are doing in-class surveys and content quizzes at the beginning and end of each semester.  So far, we have about 12 datasets and that will increase by 3 each semester.  We will also likely pull more historical data for comparison. We need to analyze how the classes with the new teaching methods are influencing student achievement. 

So, given we have many relational datasets across students and courses, would SQL be useful for managing the data? So far I'm going through complex merging acrobatics every time I need to run a different analysis.

I am absolutely new to SQL, but am really interested in learning it. I’ve taken my first course and want to keep going. 

However, if it’s not too much to ask, I’d really like to gain insight as to what a typical task for a data analyst actually looks like.

Keep in mind, I really don’t have prior knowledge of how things work between the analyst and the employer, so be patient with me. You may think some of these questions are silly.

Specifically, I’m wondering:

How do you receive all of the data from whomever you’re analyzing data for?

Does your client or employer typically tell you what information or data they need?

How do you present or compile all of this data for your employer? 

What kind of data do you typically analyze, and do you go about it? Do you have to create tables for every variable that they might need (demographics, age, name information, etc.)?

I have a table I created which has the following fields:

|car\_id|model\_name|status|
|:-|:-|:-|


I have created this by using the following query:

    select distinct car_id, merchant_name, status from (
    select c.car_id, c.model_name, s.status from cars c
    inner join stats s
    on s.car_id= c.car_id)

The problem is that I don't want to have the field ""status"" as distinct, but I want to have it as ""0"" or ""1"" based on if a set of car\_id &amp; model\_name was ever sold in the past.

so the field ""status"" should be changed to ""has\_been\_sold"" and contain 1 or 0 based if the car\_id &amp; model\_name has had ""had been sold"" as a value in the ""status"" field in the past.",how to add a constraint to a set of values based on history,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/pjode0/how_to_add_a_constraint_to_a_set_of_values_based/,

Thanks for taking the time to check out my post. I'm currently working with a Postgres DB and am trying to take a rolling average with some NaT values in the rows. The rolling average is working so far, but the average is omitting any NaT row, which is skewing the overall monthly average. The average will divide by 1 when there are 3 consecutive NaT's, when it should be the first\_sale\_avg digit + the 3 0's, and then divide by 4 to get the monthly rolling average. 

My query is returning something along the lines of:

&amp;#x200B;

|date|first\_sale\_avg (in days)|Monthly\_Rolling\_sale\_avg (4 months)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|12/19|5 days|5|

|6/20|NaT|22.5|
|7/20|NaT|25|

|:-|:-|

I can only import data for a current pay period because previous pay periods are locked. 

So I query all the data in this import file starting with the new pay period date. I have a column that says whether something should be Start of Shift, End of Shift, Start of Lunch, End of Lunch. I use a CASE to convert these to numbers and order by so that my punches are than in order with 1 = Start of Shift, 2 = Start of Lunch, 3 = End of Lunch, 4 = End of Shift.

I import these punches into my new time keeping software in that order. 

Here is the edge case I'm running into. Employee X works late on Sunday night at the end of a pay period. They punch out early Monday morning to end their shift at 1:30 am. 

How can I delete rows from my import tables if the first row on a specific date (start of pay period) for a given employee is not a Start of Shift punch?

I'm a network engineer, so my SQL skills fall into the ""enough knowledge to break something really well""-level. Don't assume I know something in your solution as I probably don't.

I am building a tool for syncing data from a less than friend employee management system into various other systems. What I am attempting to do is create a view that merges multiple rows in such a way that the unique data from each row shows up as a numbered column in the view.

The specifics are such:

Two tables: EMPLOYEE and EMAILS

EMPLOYEE contains EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, etc  
EMAILS contains EmployeeID, EmailAddress, PrimaryEmail, etc where PrimaryEmail is a binary indicator of which listed Email is the employees main one. All others are aliases for e-mail only. There is a finite number of e-mails permitted per employee (roughly 25)

It is a fairly trivial thing to join the two columns and sort or search by EmployeeID to get a list of all the user's e-mails as sequential rows. However, I require a view that lists the e-mails as columns with names such as PrimaryEmailAddress, AliasEmailAddress0, AliasEmailAddress1, AliasEmailAddress2, etc.

All examples I can find demonstrate this with a solution where the alias e-mail addresses are concatenated into a single text field, usually in a CSV format. I would like to maintain the individual rows.

If it matters, the backend is SQLite3 and I'm using Python for most of the programming, but I want to do the actual data manipulation in the SQL, not in Python.

&amp;#x200B;

The task is to select the total number of all Returns ( *Fact\_return\_date is not NULL) for each user\_id. In case there are no returns, the corresponding query result should be 0. In case there are no credits at all, the result should be NULL.* 

I've managed to find solution in 2 steps: 

First I create table *credits\_closed:*

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS credits_closed
    SELECT user_id,
    sum( case when Fact_return_date IS NOT NULL then 1 else 0 end ) as total_closed_credits
    FROM quiz_assignments.test5
    GROUP BY user_id
    ORDER BY user_id; 

Which results in: 

&amp;#x200B;

[table credits\_closed](https://preview.redd.it/zza54uv82te71.jpg?width=326&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bf53d54f5519f65f68f2942335e0b0472262b2d)

And then I do left join:

    SELECT test4.User_id, credits_closed.total_closed_credits
    FROM quiz_assignments.test4
    LEFT JOIN quiz_assignments.credits_closed
    ON test4.User_id = credits_closed.user_id;

* For a given **Season**, an **Entity** can own any quantity of shares for a given **SharesType**
* For a given **Season**, an **Entity's** owned shares may be used by either the owning **Entity** or any number of other **Entity's**. I will have to perform checking that the total of all **SharesUsage** rows related to a particular owning **Entity** is less than or equal to the owning **Entity's** **SharesOwnership** value.
* Also, the ownership and usage of shares is consistent across any given **Season**, so there's no worry about these values changing half-way through a **Season**.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have at this point, but I'm wondering if I've overlooked a simpler solution.

I'm new to creating SQL tables and am trying to figure out what the best practise would be in my particular situation. I'm building a little python application to suggest some movies to me. My main table ('movies') contains data on tonnes of movies, information like; title, year, director, desc, imdb score, image....etc. My little app will reference this table when it want to look up movie information.

Now separately in another part of my app I will have different custom lists of movies. For example;

* Most popular movies
* Trending now
* Most streamed
* Out now in box office

I will create these lists using python getting data from different sources.

My big questions is; how should these lists be stored in my SQL db? My first thought is that each list would be a separate table with a unique ID that maps the movie back to the main table ('movies') and some of these tables might gave extra columns for example: Box office takings in $$.

Then my second thought was that maybe there should be extra columns in my main 'movies' database that somehow records what list this movie is in. For example a columns that is called 'lists' which has all the lists it's part of -- but this just seems crazy and poor design.

The only issue i can see with my first thought is what if I have tonnes of lists? I'll end up with one large 'movies' table and tonnes of small tables which are simply lists of movie IDs - but maybe thats alright?

And assuming I'm trying to load this data from a single csv file with two columns, Student\_Name and Advisor\_Name, I've always done this in a brute force way which seems to get more unorganized the more linkages we have.

What I would currently do here is:

1. Read in the full csv.
2. Do a for loop over each row:
   1. Open a SQL transaction.
   2. Query whether record exists for Advisor\_Name value, if so:
      1. Get existing primary key for Advisor\_Name.
   3. Else:
      1. Insert new record for Advisor\_Name, get new primary key for Advisor\_Name.
   4. Query whether record exists for Student\_Name value, if so:
      1. Do Nothing.
   5. Else:
      1. Insert new record for Student\_Name.
   6. Commit the SQL transaction assuming no errors.

I guess when written out this looks a lot cleaner, but in my code, it get's complicated when I need to deal with up to a dozen primary keys per row, and I need to do multiple SQL queries to check and insert data per row of my data file.

I have this line of code:

$result = $conn-&gt;query($sql); &lt;------- **Crashes here (as you might expect).** 

I have a whole series of queries on the site which all execute perfectly but when it encounters this query the page fails to load.

I copied the query and pasted it directly into MySqlAdmin and it runs perfectly providing the expected result.

&amp;#x200B;

 In this tutorial, we will...

* Download a tool for writing and executing SQL
* Use SQL to analyze data
* Learn how to create a simple data visualization

**This tutorial is not intended to give you an in-depth explanation of how SQL works, or to go into any technical details of databases. The goal is to show you how SQL can be used in a hands-on approach.**

You can view the images linked here along with the full tutorial [here](https://app.sixweeksql.com/blog)

&amp;#x200B;

**It All Starts With the Data**

Lets download some data from [Louisville Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/). The dataset we are going to use is crime data collected by the city of Louisville, KY from 2018. [You can download it here](http://lky-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/LMPD/Crime_Data_2018.csv) directly or on the [Louisville Open Data Crime Reports page](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-reports)

After you've downloaded the data set, let's take a look at it. You can view it with excel, some other spreadsheet program, or just notepad, if that's all you have. This dataset is formatted as a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (comma-separated values). Each row is on its own line, and each value is separated by a comma.

Here is what it looks like if viewed in a spreadsheet program. Note that a spreadsheet program will not show the commas. If you're viewing in a plain text editor, like notepad, it will look much different.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/crime-rows.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/crime-rows.png)

It looks like every row represents a reported crime. This is a pretty interesting dataset if you ask me. Personally, I have so many questions!

* Which zip codes experience the most car theft?
* What times of the day are crimes most likely to occur?
* Which crimes are most popular?

Without some type of technology to aid us, answering these questions would be difficult, to say the least. There are almost 80,000 rows in this spreadsheet. Lucky for us, we are going to use SQL to aid us in our efforts. Lets get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**Download a tool so we can use SQL**

We need a **SQL client** that can interpret and execute SQL. For this tutorial, we will use **DB Browser for SQLite**. Its a simple and light weight tool that is used to manage data. It knows how to interpret and execute SQL. [You can download the tool here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

If you've got a somewhat newer windows pc, you probably have a 64 bit machine, and can download the version highlighted below.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/download-db-browser.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/download-db-browser.png)

After its downloaded, right click the file and choose **Extract All**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/extract.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/extract.png)

Once the zip file is extracted, navigate to the **DB Browser for SQLite** folder and find the **DB Browser for SQLite** Application file (exe). Open the application.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/application.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/application.png)

Once you start the application, you should see it open. It looks like this:

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/app-view.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/app-view.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Create a Database**

A database is just a container for your data, and we will need one for this tutorial. Select **New Database**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-db.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-db.png)

Type in a name for your database (I named mine crime), and click **Save**.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/save-db-file.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/save-db-file.png)

A window will pop up that prompts you to create a new table inside of your database. Just close it.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/close-prompt.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/close-prompt.png)

Import Louisville Crime Data

Next, we will use the **import** tool provided by **DB Browser for SQLite** to get our Louisville Crime dataset loaded into it. File &gt; Import &gt; Table From CSV File...

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import.png)

Find and select your Louisville Crime dataset that you downloaded earlier and click **Open**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/find-crime.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/find-crime.png)

The **DB Browser for SQLite** import tool is going to use our csv (comma separated values) file to create a database table. You can pick the name of the database table at this step. I've shortened my table name to **Crime**. Click **Okay** once you're ready to create the table.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import-wizard.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/import-wizard.png)

Under the **Database Structure** tab, you should now see the new table listed.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-table.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/new-table.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Start Writing Some SQL**

If you've gotten this far, pat yourself on the back! We are now ready to execute our first bit of SQL. Navigate to the **Execute SQL** tab and enter the SQL you see below. We are going to select all columns (\*) from the **Crime** table, but only the first 10 rows. If you named your table something other than crime, you will need to use that name instead. Click the execute SQL button once you're ready to execute your SQL.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/execute-tab.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/execute-tab.png)

You should see the results of your query below the text editor, where you typed in your SQL.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/first-result.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/first-result.png)

You can adjust the size of the results window by hovering over the right edge.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/adjust-grid.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/adjust-grid.png)

Let's write our next SQL query. Copy the SQL you see below and execute it. Examine the SQL, and the results. Are they what you expected?

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assault-query.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assault-query.png)

Next, lets edit our query to only show assaults that occurred in zip code 40215. Check out the extra information below the grid. It indicates there were 821 rows returned.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assaults-40215.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/assaults-40215.png)

This query will yield each unique value found in the **CRIME\_TYPE** column. It looks lilke there are 16 different crime types in the table.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/distinct-crime-type.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/distinct-crime-type.png)

**If you're up to it, try running some of your own queries. It is okay if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Experimenting and learning through discovery is the best way to learn in my opinion**

Using the extra information below the results grid, lets see how many burglaries were reported in 2018.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/burglary-count.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/burglary-count.png)

Now lets see how many homicides were reported in 2018

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/homicide-count.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/homicide-count.png)

How do you think the **GROUP BY** command works?

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png)

Here we can use the **GROUP BY** command on the ZIP\_CODE column to get a count of crimes reported in each zip code.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip.png)

Add this **WHERE** clause so we can get a count of vehicle break-ins for each zip code. The **NULL** value indicates there was no data entered in the zip code for 350 rows.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip-vehicle.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by-zip-vehicle.png)

You can add the **ORDER BY** clause to order the results by a particular column.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/order-by.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/order-by.png)

We can add another condition onto our **WHERE** clause to exclude the ***NULL*** values. Usually, you will use the **&lt;&gt;** or **!=** operators when you want to specify ""not equal to"", but NULL values are different.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/not-null.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/not-null.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Create a Data Visualization**

Next up, we are going to create a data visualization like the one below

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/bar-chart.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/bar-chart.png)

Let's go back to our query where we group by crime type and get a count

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/group-by.png)

Execute the query, and click the upper left corner of the graph. This will select the data. You can copy it with **control + c**.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/select-data.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/select-data.png)

Head to [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). It is an online tool for creating data visualizations. You do not need an account to use the tool. Click the **Start Creating** button to get started

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/start-creating.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/start-creating.png)

Paste the data you copied from **DB Browser for SQLite** with **control + v**

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/paste.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/paste.png)

Click proceed to go to the next step

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/proceed.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/proceed.png)

Despite our data being haphazardly pasted in, the tool did a good job formatting it for us. Click Proceed to go to the next step.

[https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/formatted.png](https://app.sixweeksql.com/assets/blog/crime-tutorial/formatted.png)

I have to tables, one of them contains general info about a product, one of them is a possible procedure. Goal is to write a stored procedure that lists all procedures that are available for the product.

Example:

Procedures

ProcedureName | Conditions
---|---
procedure1 | country = 'us' and color = 'red'
procedure2 | discounted = 1

Products

ProductName | Country | Color | Discounted
---|---|----|----
product1 | us | red | 1
product2 | gb | red | 0
product3 | de | red | 1
product4 | fr | red | 0

    exec GetAvailablesProcedures @productName='product1'

should return both procedure1 and procedure2

    exec GetAvailablesProcedures @productName='product2'

should return nothing

    exec GetAvailablesProcedures @productName='product3'

should return only procedure2

The important things are that this should be SQL only and I don't have to worry about SQL injection attacks.

I already have a stored procedure that returns 1 or 0 depending given a procedureID and productID that checks the condition.
I'm not sure how to use that to get a table of all available procedures though.

When I was working at my previous job, some queries were getting pretty big and ugly, and I started thinking about some kind of tool that could make building my SQL queries cleaner and more convenient. I thought that there must be a better way to organize queries other than in a wall of text.

Someone pointed to me that there were already some software like Alteryx and Knime that are visual, but for my objective (to just visually organize SQL queries) these were overkill and overbudget. Also, their dark theme is either non-existent or ugly as hell.

There are also other tools like Chartio's Visual SQL and Active Query Builder that are kinda ""visual"", but not the kind of visual that I wanted. So I decided to create my own.

Supports all modern browsers. Also supports tablets and IE11. Dark mode by default, light mode isn't even a consideration.

The groups/tasks/subtasks of each user are private and will only be seen by them.

Would it be as simple as just having a table of users, groups, tasks and subtasks and connecting them through primary and foreign keys? It just seems inefficient for a user to get the same few tasks out of a list of potentially millions/billions of rows.

I am a mechanical engineer but I managed to shift my career to some kind of a reporting specialist roughly 3 years ago and I want to be a Data Analyst. 

Since I'm not working at the BI department, I don't have the authority to access the Datawarehouse via SQL (I asked they said it's not possible), I can only export reports to xlsx or csv files, and do my analysis by concatenating/manipulating them.

I generally write VBA to automate business tasks of my department and create dashboards with PowerBI (Comprehensive reports, mainly using DAX, some reports are fed by roughly 20 million rows via Powerquery).

I try to learn SQL by myself, but SQL courses are not like python courses, with python for instance you can go deeper and deeper with tutorials and hands-on experience. But with SQL every course teaches SELECT, UPDATE CREATE, JOIN, UNION etc. and stops there, I cannot find any course that goes really deep.

So, last week my dream came true and an HR Requrieter wrote me and asked if I was interested in a Data Analyst position, then we arranged a meeting, and when everything was going great, in the middle of the meeting, she asked me to if I was using SQL actively on my work, I said I don't but I'm trying to learn it by myself, and she was very disappointed like *""there is no point of proceeding meeting disappointed"".*

So my question is  I want to advance at SQL, so in the next meeting with another company, SQL wouldn't be the dealbreaker, but I believe I need to have tasks and projects and get my hands dirty but I can't find anywhere I'm lost.

My question is do you know any hands-on project course or a website that goes really really deep. Or do you have any other recommendations? Any suggestion would be much appreciated.",SQL Hands on Projects Recommendations,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnSQL/comments/od11qp/sql_hands_on_projects_recommendations/,

Of course, I appreciate any feedback you can provide!

The course picks up where introductory books/courses leave off, starting with Window Functions and moving on to topics like subqueries/CTEs, temp tables, query optimization, and even a little procedural SQL programming. There's also an abundance of coding exercises, some quite challenging, sprinkled throughout the course to reinforce the concepts.

SQL Server is used for the examples and exercises, but most of the content would be applicable to the vast majority of database systems.

Please note that this is an *advanced* course, so I'm assuming you have a solid background in SQL foundations: applying criteria with WHERE, JOINs, aggregate queries, etc..

I've taken probably 6 courses through Coursera and my experience has been by-and-large positive. But this course is god awful and I can't tell if it's me or the subject matter. Generally speaking it:

* Covers topics in passing and expects you to internalize that topic
* Provides no slides to review which, given the first bullet, is almost required
* The instructor (at least this first one) is evidently reading from cards and she's not a great reader. Frequently tripping over words, or finishing a sentence only to realize there are three more words. 
* There's a ton of mini-quizes which is fine, but it also has a ""check all the right answers"" which is both wildly pedantic and in many instances neither provable or educational

I am learning SQL and recently finished a course which has given me the confidence to write queries and do joins etc.

However, what I would like to understand is E-R diagrams- how to read them and also when to use 2 primary keys to join a table? When to use foreign keys to join a table? 

For example, at work I have got this quite complex E-R diagram. I am just looking at two entities (which are tables) and both these entities have 2 primary keys which are the same in both the tables. How do I know if I should be joining the tables by using both primary keys? Or even better if I can figure out what would have happened if I tried joining the tables using only one of the primary keys.

However, if I want to return a column with the name of the parent (dolor) rather than the index (3), that's where I get stumped.

I have logged the results for the last 300 games (or 100 evenings) using various metrics (who played the first wildcard for example) to get stats as an academic exercise.

Sometimes I might win all three games and other times, she might, though these ""grand slam"" events are rare (see the sample table below). 

I want to find a way to check the records (added sequentially) to check the winner of each group of three to count the number of grand slam wins each. In the illustration below, on the 8th evening (or games 22 to 24), my wife won all three games and the 3rd evening (games 7 to 9) I did. 

I keep the data on a spreadsheet and import into My Sql and now need a query to parse the records in groups of three to see if there was a common winner. Any suggestions or questions?

Just to confirm - this is not to find who won any three consecutive games but who won three games in a single evening.

89,Sergeei13,1627276206,False,"I've had a take-home assignment from one of my interviews where (among everything else) I needed to design a decent DB (they wanted relational) and queries for it. Could you please take a look and tell if this is super bad or actually ok for this use-case. I would really appreciate any reasonable feedback on how to improve. Thank you.  


&gt;!Just a side note: I'm mostly a front-end dev shifting to back-end only, and when it comes to SQL I feel I got so rusty on it that I could understand relational data and write queries better in the uni than I do them now as a sorta experienced dev, sooo please be understanding!&lt;  


To the requirements.  
I need to build some kind of organizations catalogue with three entities:  
**Building**  
\- Stores line address (all in one varchar, doesn't matter now);  
\- And its location (lat/lon);  
**Organization**  
\- has a name;  
\- has 1 or more phone numbers (phone numbers are unique across all orgs);  
\- has 1 or more categories it belongs to;  
**Org Category**   
This should be a hierarchical structure with no limit on depths. E.g. ""Food"" -&gt; ""Restaurants"" -&gt; ""Asian"",  ""Food"" -&gt; ""Restaurants"" -&gt; ""European"",  ""Food"" -&gt; ""Drive-throughs"", etc, I think you get the point.  
\- Has only one field: unique name;  


And here are the queries I need to run on this DB from the server:  
\- List organizations in given building;  
\- List organizations in given category;  
\- Get organization data by id;  
\- Add new building together with orgs in it;  


Here's the init migration script I wrote: [https://gist.github.com/TofuOverdose/d5f320d52bc6c6d9dfc9294f329947db](https://gist.github.com/TofuOverdose/d5f320d52bc6c6d9dfc9294f329947db)

As for the queries, this is where things get really bad for me. Adding new building is fine: I don't think there's any other way than just running a transaction (insert building then orgs, rollback if constraints don't work). However, I cannot come up with good queries for fetching all the data, with the structure so heavily normalized.  
Let's see how  ""Get organization data by id"" would work for example. Response from my server should look like this:  


    {
        ""id"": 123,
        ""name"": ""Test company 1"",
        ""phoneNumbers"": [""10000000001"", ""10000000002"", ""10000000003""],
        ""categories"": [
            { ""id"": 111, ""name"": ""category 1"" },
            { ""id"": 222, ""name"": ""category 2"" },
            { ""id"": 333, ""name"": ""category 3"" }
        ]
    } 

Which means I need to also `JOIN` simple `WHERE` set for `organizations` table with  
1. `orgs_categories` table to get categories mapping;  
2. `categories` to get actual data from the mapping;  
3. `orgs_phone_numbers` to list phone numbers (thanks god the ids are all I need);  
With joins I obviously get a lot of repetitive data, so what I do is just loop through rows on my server after calling the db and aggregate unique data (for phone numbers and categories) to get nice arrays as in json above.  
And this was just a simple query for single organization. You can probably imagine how it looks for a list of organizations, given that I need to respond with the same structure as for a single one. Or if the requirements change and I need to show the entire category structure (levels below the selected one). This is also very inefficient for the server (mostly memory-wise because of temporary arrays and lookup tables).   
I feel like this is a very generic issue with a generic solution, but since I'm not experienced (and even during that short experience use-cases were simple and we just used all kinds of ORMs to deal with databases), I can't come up with a decent solution and I feel so dumb.  
How can this be solved in the database? Is it so hard because its design is bad? Or is it usually the server's concern to later sort the results and should look into solutions for my specific language?

Apologies if this doesnt belowing here.

im attempting pull data into excel and have written the below query

    SELECT a.item, a.trx_date, a.trx_type, a.order_no, a.status, a.order_date, a.trx_ref, a.loc1, a.loc2, a.des, a.qty, a.unit, a.invoice_no, a.grn, a.grade, a.reason, a.size, a.trx_time, a.process, c.stock_type

    LEFT JOIN app.stkmas AS c ON a.item=c.item
    WHERE c.grn_item=1

The query works if manually set the WHERE clause in the subquery to value i want, but that obviously cant work for me long term.
