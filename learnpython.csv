I know the basics of the language - been learning since August 2020 and recently became actually happy seeing I know something. After hitting wall after wall after wall, seems like things are coming together. I even have almost 300 kata on codewars - trust me, to someone that attempted doing exercises there multiple times, only to swear never to go back after 30min, I now feel like I'm close to hacking Pentagon and getting the nuke codes.

Now I feel like I should look into OOP more - I know how you create class, it's methods and all that beginner stuff, but I lack true understanding of when and really how to use it.

Are there any books on OOP that you can recommend? I'm asking for books because that learning style really suits me, I like to read a lot first, then type some code to practice, then at the very end I can only think of building something on my own. I know it's highly recommended here to 'find something you like and build it', but it's not exactly for me yet.

As part of the root-cause analysis, the dev team has been given the task of finding all places where dictionaries are being directly accessed by key name and replacing it with a `.get()` and providing a default value to prevent crashes.

I'm exceedingly lazy, which is why I got into coding in the first place, and I naturally don't want to parse through piles of my own garbage looking for it.. plus I, a human, am more likely to miss one or two of them on the way.

****Create a dictionary of name_age, which includes the 
following information: 

Bob is 24, Jackie is 19, 
Tom is 23. In the dictionary, the keys are the 
names and the values are corresponding ages. 
 ——————————————————————-
#2

 Now, what if we want to add a new key-
value pair to our dictionary. For example, you got a new pet dog, whose name is Tucker. How do you add Tucker to your pet_type dictionary?
 
pet_type['Tucker'] = 'dog'
 
See the pattern? To illustrate the pattern, let’s use Dict to represent a general dictionary. To 


******Challenge 2: add a new key-value pair (or an element) to name_age dictionary for Van whose age is 26 and print the updated dictionary out
——————————————————————-

#3

What about when we want to remove an element from a dictionary. Let’s say, your new 
roommate is allergic to cat and you have to send Molly back home to be taken care of 
by your parents (just saying). You don’t need to keep Molly in the pet_type dictionary anymore. Let’s remove it:
 
del pet_type['Molly']
 
Simple enough, right? 
Let print the pet_type dictionary again to check - 
 
print(pet_type)
 
Can you still see Molly?
 
As you have noticed, Bella and Tucker are both dogs. You want to use their breeds (Bella is 
a Siberian Husky and Tucker is a Bulldog) to represent their animal type. So, you will need 
To change the values corresponding to Bella and tucker :

pet_type['Bella'] = 'Siberian Husky'
 
pet_type['Tucker'] = 'Bulldog'
 

***** Well, someday, you wanted to give Bella a new name : 

Well, that is the third challenge. Here are some hints: you need to create a new key
-value 
pair with the updated key and then delete the old key
-value pair (Bella-Siberian Husky)

————————————————————————

#4 

use a for loop to iterate through the key
-value pairs in a dictionary and print the whole dictionary pair by pair. 

for i in pet_type: print (i+' : '+ pet_type[i])
 

*****Now, here is the fourth challenge
: print out the elements in name_age dictionary in the same format (as how we printed out the pet_type). 
 

(HINT: you will need to convert the age into string variables using str() function instead of using name _age

————————————————————————
 #5

****Here is your fifth challenge. Create a word_length_count dictionary (the same format as the word_length dictionary example in the first question. 

Hint: you will first create an empty dictionary, then use a for loop to iterate through the words in words_lst. You will use the len() function (within the for loop) to get the length of each word. Then you can add key-value pair to the empty dictionary (within the for loop)

Empty dictionary : word_length_count = {}

Write content to text file :

Similar to the format we used to print out the element in pet_type (see the previous example).

In order to increase the efficiency of the 2nd function, I had the 1st function check whether the number it was testing was divisible by 2, this way I could later skip all the even numbers when checking whether a number was prime. But why stop there? Check if it's divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, and skip all the multiples of those numbers. Basically, if my 2nd function could keep track of all the prime numbers it's found so far, the 1st function could use those to test whether a number is prime, thereby saving lots of time by skipping all the composite numbers.

next to get all rows I tried using the class name instead like this:

35,CodeYourOwnWay,1645884136,False,"I'm on lesson 14 of Paul McWhorters Python series, this lesson involved going over reading and writing data files.  Which so far I have enjoyed but this episode left me feeling like I was left using some new things I didn't really understand the way I did in previous lessons. So I'm hoping some of you folks can help me out. Apologies in advance for the super basic questions.

The code from the episode is below:

&gt;import pickle   
fruits=\['apples','oranges','bananas'\]  
x=7  
y=3.14  
nuts=\['pistachio','cashew'\]  
grades=\[99,100,77,43,90\]  
dataset=\[nuts,y,x,fruits,grades\]  
with open('myData.pkl','wb')as f:  
 pickle.dump(dataset,f)  
with open ('myData.pkl','rb') as f2:  
 bigkahuna=pickle.load(f2)  
print (bigkahuna)  
for dt in bigkahuna:  
 print(dt)

Line1: This is the first time I've seen ""import"" used in a line of code. He just kinda starts using it and doesn't say anything about it. Obviously its some what self-explanatory but I'd like to understand where is pickle being imported from and why does it have to be imported? Why can't it just be pickle rather than import pickle?

Line8: Again, first time I've seen ""with"" used. There was no real explanation just began using it. So I'm wondering what exactly does ""with open"" mean? (man I sound dumb lol). What is the ""with"" statement doing, i.e why is it not just ""open"" rather than ""with open"".

Next also in line8 after ""with open"" its ""('myData.pkl',wb')"". My understanding is this is the file path? So what file exactly is ""myData.pkl""? I thought it was the name of the file he was working on in the lesson but its not that was named ""myPickle"".

Line13: in previous for loops we used e.g for ""i in range (0,numgrades,1)"". In this line the range function is left out entirely but still has the same affect. So I was wondering, why did we use that previously? Is it just for special instances if you wanted to tweak parameters such as instead of starting at 0, start at 1 or instead of 0 through to numgrades do 0 through to numgrades+1? Is it the case if you just miss out the range function it will do a default step through of the list from 0 to the end of the array one step at a time?

I've just made my first twitter bot using tweepy and requests. It basically extracts fantasy league stats and provides some commentary for changes made that week and idenfitfies who did best. Nothing fancy but I am proud of it!

All the functionality works, I now just need to host it somehow so I don't have to run it once a week. Any recommendations on where to do this? I plan on making more programs that will need hosting (just small projects, nothing big) so I don't mind signing up for a monthly plan that I can host multiple programs on.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I will program a trigger to make the information be pulled and tweeted. Am I correct in thinking I can just have a while loop going which will run when a certain variable changes? For example, could I use the below:

&amp;#x200B;

    gameweek = 28
    while gameweek == 28:
        get_gameweek() #This will use requests to identify the game week.
    else:

Would the general idea work? I will obviously play around with it to make sure. Just not sure if I am missing some general practices in this regard. It will be my first constantly active programme.

The folder in the virtual environment is not a github repo (`conda/envs/env_name/Lib/site_packages/zing/`). Should I just make it a repo, and make it a branch and do a PR based on that?

What I have done previously seems super inefficient: I make changes in that local version in `site_packages`, and then when I am happy, I do a whole separate fork of the package from github, make those changes in a branch in that fork, and then do a PR based on that.

This is a simulation of a spacecraft (represented by a cube) traveling between planets in a solar system, in a Hohmann Transfer Orbit.   A Hohman Transfer Orbit is half of an elliptical orbit with one end at the starting point and the other end at the destination. It is the minimum energy trajectory between two orbits.  

There is also the launch window to be calculated. The planets are moving targets which you have to hit, launching from another planet which is also moving. You have to launch when your starting point and the destination are in the proper position, so that the spacecraft and target planet arrives at the same point in space at the same time.   

 The program was written using Vpython and copypasted into GlowScript. You can run the program yourself in the link below and see its source.   

[https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/zorniy/folder/Physics/program/OrbitalRendezvous](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/zorniy/folder/Physics/program/OrbitalRendezvous)

Hopefully you might find it useful as a demonstration in physics/astronomy class.   I wrote this program mainly to practice object oriented programming.

VPython is a library that allows simple 3D objects (eg. spheres, cones and cubes) to be created and animated. GlowScript is a web implementation of VPython that converts it into JavaScript and allow the simulation to be embedded on a webpage. It has been described as 3D programming for mortals.

One more thing. It seems VPython is a very niche thing. Have I been practicing something that is about to be abandoned? What would you suggest in its place? Preferably something that can be embedded in HTML, yet not too complex. Take a look at the code I wrote for the level I'm looking for. I spent far more time working out the physics and mathematics than the code. I'm a total noob in JavaScript. Brython looks good, but the webpage seems to indicate to me that it is also very niche and could be abandoned soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on a Battleships game with Pygame. This is my first attempt at making any kind of graphical game, I'd not touched Pygame before, so a definite learning experience for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciated if anyone has tips/advice/critique, things I could have done better, or point out any silly mistakes I have made!

&amp;#x200B;

Link to repository: [https://github.com/hbarwick/Battleships](https://github.com/hbarwick/Battleships)

&amp;#x200B;

I do have one game breaking bug that I've not yet figured out, so if anyone can spot what is causing it it will stop me going mad!

The game seemingly randomly gets stuck at line 584. Previously it would crash, as the `enemy_grid.get_cell()` method would on occasion return None instead of a Cell - crashing out due to no `is_clicked` attribute.

I added the while loop to keep trying to get mouse position to attempt to avoid this, but this just has the effect of getting the game stuck in the loop.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on this in dribs and drabs for a few weeks and am starting to get bored with the project, so posting now to get some feedback before I burn out on it totally.

    DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib...

Here is the original call:

    fp, pathname, description = imp.find_module(pluginfile, pluginpath)

and the code I updated it to:

    spec = importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec(pluginfile, pluginpath)

Each of the files of interest in this folder is a "".tif"" file, and so an image. The files in this folder go: Blue\_111.tif, Blue\_124.tif, Blue\_145.tif, Blue\_165.tif, Blue\_176.tif... and then: Red\_111.tif, Red\_124.tif, Red\_145.tif, Red\_165.tif, Red\_176.tif... and so on. The numbers associated with each of these files do not, as shown, go in equal interval order, but that is not relevant here. The point is that for each Blue file, there is a matching Red file with the same numbered extension attached to the file name.

Not trying to get into GIS raster analysis here, since this subreddit is specifically focused on python, but what I am trying to do is multiply each Red and Blue file with the same file name number extension, to then produce an output .tif file. I would then want to produce the calculated output (we'll call this ""Green"") .tif file with the same numbered extension in the file name. For example, for the example files shown above, I would do:

Blue\_111.tif x Red\_111.tif = Green\_111.tif

Blue\_124.tif x Red\_124.tif = Green\_124.tif

Blue\_145.tif x Red\_145 = Green\_145.tif

The main question I am trying to get at here, is how do I loop through my directory folder and access the matching Blue and Red files? This pseudocode shows conceptually what I am trying to do.

    folder = Path/to/Directory/Folder
    
    for f in folder that begins with ""Blue"":
        ext = extract numbered extension from file name
        r = find matching ""Red"" file with ext in file name
        green = f * r
        write green to new .tif file with ext in file name

I felt it would be too much here to get into the actually code of how these raster files are multiplied, and I am not sure it is so relevant here, since the file name number extension matching is what I am really after here.

Shortly before Xmas I made a short program that used pytube. 

I didn't touch this program for a few weeks and went to use it today only to find it not working couldn't figure out why and only idea is that the modules used are no longer the same possibly updated or changed in some way that has killed the whole program.

I'm wondering if it is even possible to download a module to have it saved locally to avoid it being changed / updated by the original author?

Guess this would sort of fall into that grey area maybe considered stealing code but I would counter I only intend for this to be used in personal use so would think would be ok?

2. How do I make the program accept 'easy' and 'help' in both upper and lower case? Is this possible?
3. Lastly, the program works but whenever I add in a space before typing in 'help', it prints 'Bon Appétit'. How can I make the program accept spaces in the input?

Yesterday, my code stopped working after running for about 60 hours.

During that time, the algorithm had a total of 400,000 loops. And the looping speed did not slow down throughout the whole process, so I do not think the problem is related to memory leaks (although I can be wrong as I'm not very informed about this matter)

There were no connection issues and I was not banned by the server/exchange (which is Binance).

However, most experienced Python developers see it lacks environment support unlike Node.js, Rust, and other languages.

Another issue was difficulty publishing to PyPi. Not seriously difficult, but difficult enough to burden the developer with lots of configurations. 

So I made [Choam](https://github.com/cowboycodr/choam). A Python package/environment manager.

After installation it’s as simple as 

python3 -m choam new &lt;project_name&gt;

to start a new project 

You can also manage dependencies and other project configurations via a Choam.toml file. 

But the most useful feature, in my opinion is the ability to publish Python packages to pypi in 2-commands 

python3 -m choam setup 

(Sets up configuration file, while retaining configurations from Choam.toml, and allows you to change configurations how you choose)

And 

python3 - choam publish

55,ciscocollab,1643264243,False,"I'm seeing some behaviour with Python 3.8 and the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor method which I'm not sure is working as designed. What my script does is requests multiple RTSP streams from an RTSP server and then uses OpenCV to save the first frame as a jpg. Here is my code:

    from cv2 import VideoCapture, imwrite
    import concurrent.futures
    import time
    from config import rtsp_user, rtsp_password, rtsp_ip_address, rtsp_port
    
    channels = {
        'front_left': '2',
        'front_right': '3',
        'water_tank': '1',
        'laundry': '5',
        'alfresco': '4'
        }
    
    def get_frame(channel_number, channel_name):
       rtsp_url = f'rtsp://{rtsp_user}:{rtsp_password}@{rtsp_ip_address}:{rtsp_port}/chID={channel_number}&amp;streamType=main'
       print(f'About to visit {rtsp_url}')
       success, image = VideoCapture(rtsp_url).read()
       if success:
           imwrite(f'{channel_name}.jpg', image)
           print('Successfully wrote file')
    
    def main(mode):
        if mode == 'sync':
            for channel in channels:
                get_frame(channels[channel], channel)
        elif mode == 'async':
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                for channel in channels:
                    executor.submit(get_frame, channels[channel], channel)
    
    
    main(mode='sync')
    main(mode='async')

When I run the code synchronously by calling main(mode='sync')  
, I see in the Wireshark what I am expecting; TCP 3-way Handshake followed by the various RTSP messages for the first stream. Then the TCP 3-way Handshake followed by the various RTSP messages for the second stream and so on. However when I run the code asynchronously by calling main(mode='async')  
, I see the same behaviour in Wireshark; TCP 3-way Handshake followed by the various RTSP messages for the first stream. Then the TCP 3-way Handshake followed by the various RTSP messages for the second stream and so on.

In comparison, when I run [this script from Corey Schafer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/master/Python/Threading/download-images.py), I am seeing the behaviour that I would have expected to happen in my script which is 15 TCP SYN's in a row in Wireshark.

When I change the script to use multiprocessing (changing to 

    concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor()

), the script execution time goes from 6.3 seconds to 1.8 seconds. My understanding was that multiprocessing is for CPU bound operations whereas threading is IO bound operations.

84,sesamesesayou,1643291336,False,"Hello all, I'm playing around with socket and scapy to test controlling different fields in the TCP header (ports, syn, ack, options, etc) and having a difficult time. I've come across an [article](https://www.binarytides.com/raw-socket-programming-in-python-linux/) which provides a great script that shows setting all of the various fields in the IP and TCP headers and have been playing around with it. However, what I have found when using wireshark to see what is actually put out onto the wire is that many of the TCP header fields aren't being sent as defined within the values I've set in my script. For example:

* I'll set an initial sequence value of a random number such as 1790539657 but the packet capture shows it as 3037637220
* I've set the TCP SYN flag to 1 in my script but the packet capture shows that flag being set to 0

Originally the script (which was a near copy of that from the article) wouldn't even allow wireshark to identify that the packet was a TCP packet, as the IP protocol field in the IP header was coming out as ff (255). I solved this by adjusting the socket definition from this:

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.IPPROTO_RAW)

to this:

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_RAW, 6)

I have actually had slightly better luck with scapy actually forming a TCP 3-way handshake by putting the packet definition into a socket (instead of using scapy's send() function directly, which had similar issues to what I have been experiencing with socket directly), but it doesn't take the source port or sequence values I've provided it:

    import socket
    from scapy.all import *
    
    ip = '192.168.1.200'
    dport=80
    
    pkt = IP(dst=ip)/TCP(sport=45223, dport=dport, seq=1790539657, flags='S')
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_RAW, 6)
    s.connect((ip, dport))
    s.send(bytes(pkt))
    s.close()

I've tested both of these methods on both a Mac (running Python 3.9) and an Ubuntu VM (running Python 3.6) and both show the same symptoms. I've ran these as root as well, otherwise doesn't seem like a raw socket will work.

End goal is to actually be able to control not just the starting TCP header fields, but to be able to control them throughout the session, such as reading and adjusting sequence and acknowledgement fields, TCP flags, etc.",Controlling TCP header with socket and scapy - fields being overwritten by host?,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/sdyt1h/controlling_tcp_header_with_socket_and_scapy/,

I have two dataframes: df1 and df2. 

How can I select ""end\_date"" from df2 for each product in df1? 

Idea is 1) if df1 product ""end\_date"" in df2 is greater than ""date"" in df1, select second max ""end\_date"" and save into another new dataframe 3.

2) if the number of end\_dates =1, then I can select future ""end\_date"", because there is no other end\_dates available and save into dataframe 3.

I was wondering if anyone could help me or guide me in the right direction regarding data collection automation.

I wrote a couple of python scripts for automatic data collection in laboratory, ran a time series database and I'm storing values in there. 

The scripts get data every 10 seconds to 10 minutes. Both using time.sleep(). I found out about cron jobs couple of days ago and Im looking into its usage instead of time.sleep().

What advantages would I have if I make them a Cron Jobs instead of using time.sleep()? Do they get to run without terminal if I go the Cron job route?
Is there any memory/CPU usage difference?

I've tried googling stuff around, but there's no single answer. Anyone out here could maybe give me a hand? Any website links or tips would be useful!

I'm just wondering even in the real world (i.e. professional environments), how crucial is code optimisation for a language such as python?  I can understand the benefits of having an appreciation for faster code, but is it actually important to use it?

what I tried and possible solutions(most are not so accurate) :

1) Location of ip address using geocoder module https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/providers/IPInfo.html (not so accurate and inconsistent results)

2) Scraping data from https://mycurrentlocation.net/ (More accurate but still wrong district it is pointing to)

3) This is a theoretical one, take image from webcam using python scan it for exif data hopefully get GPS data but python opencv(https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) is the most used module to take image using webcam but it doesn't write exif data I would like to hear answers regarding this as I would like to use this one for my project

4) Using systeminfo command in cmd https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/systeminfo and get time zone (least accurate as it shows many locations)

5) Searching my current location on google and scraping that data(wild results)

6) This is the most I am unsure about if the person is using wifi and get the location of cell phone towers nearby and triangulate the location I don't know if it's possible so

7) This is also wifi related if somebody is using wifi on their phone in the same network , somehow get the location of the phone (so it should be near 30 meters) I am also unsure about this one
8) This is a bit roundabout one 
scrape location by going to myaccount.google.com and go to my devices (something like this, it shows the devices logged into the google account) and if there is a Android device use it to find the device which when I tried led to a very very interesting discovery that it when it try to track the mobile with the account it says that it is searching using ip address so anyways my conclusions are either
a) Google have more accurate ip lookups than publicly available ones or
b) Or google forcefully takes GPS data even if it is disabled

How do I go on about this I want the most accurate result possible like down to the street if possible and what ways can I achieve this and how can I achieve this in python( if it's just a website which provides it then I think I can scrape it myself) lemme verify my objective which is to get the location of the machine where the script is running for eg if I am ""somewhere"" In England I would like to get that""somewhere "" in python or a website without any executables or any other devices like gps devices which is available in Amazon and all anyways my os is windows 7 and it is not a genuine copy and Thanks",What is the most accurate way of a getting a computer's real world location in python.,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/rpl8lu/what_is_the_most_accurate_way_of_a_getting_a/,

23,avidresolver,1640612561,False,"I've been using python and tkinter for a while now, and I'm getting more and more amazed about how inconsistent, messy, and 'un-pythonlike' it is.

For example: when creating a widget, you specify the width and height in a python-like (width=50, height=10) way in the constructor, but when creating a root window you have to specify it in a special geometry method using a weird string, ""WidthxHeight+X=Y"". Everything I know about python would suggest that should be defined maybe as two touples.

Also when trying to trigger a function when an element is interacted with, sometimes you use a ""command"" parameter, sometimes ""bind"" a command to a widget, and sometimes you have to check a StringVar or similar.

There appears to be no rhyme nor reason to what is used where.

I know there are better options for creating a GUI, I'm thinking of switching to PySimpleGUI, but I wonder how anyone thought this mess of a module was a good idea in the first place.

Setup: I've got a device on my network that broadcasts ""qCITY"" on port 20000/UDP every other second. On my PC (Linux) I can see this coming in when I do ""nc -u -l 20000 -k"": qCITYqCITYqCITY (as long as I like, a packet of five bytes every two seconds). But my Python code never receives anything.

My code:

    import socket
    import errno
    import os
    import time

    LocalPort = 20000
    BufferSize = 1536

    def get_ip():

        try:
            # doesn't even have to be reachable
            s.connect(('10.255.255.255', 1))
            IP = s.getsockname()[0]
        except Exception:
            IP = '127.0.0.1'
        finally:
            s.close()
        return IP

    LocalIP = get_ip()

    ServerSocket = socket.socket( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM )
    ServerAddress = ( LocalIP, LocalPort )
    ServerSocket.bind( ServerAddress )
    ServerSocket.setblocking(0)

    print( 'IP:' + LocalIP + ' Port:' + str(LocalPort) )
    print( 'Blocking:' + str(ServerSocket.getblocking()) + ' Timeout:' + str(ServerSocket.gettimeout()) )
    while True:
        try:
            print( 'Try' )
            Data, Address = ServerSocket.recvfrom( BufferSize )
        except socket.error as e:
            print( 'Except' )
            err = e.args[0]
            if err==errno.EAGAIN or err==errno.EWOULDBLOCK:
                print( 'EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK' )
                time.sleep(1.0)
                print( 'No data available' )
                continue
            else:
                print( 'Real Error' )
                # a ""real"" error occurred

            clientIP  = ""Client IP Address:{}"".format(Address)
            print(clientMsg)
            print(clientIP)

Most of it is copied from various sources (like that get_ip() call), so forgive me if I mixed styles or did things in odd ways (but then please tell me how to do this better). I don't even know if the receiving ""else"" would actually print the right stuff, as I never ever reached it...

It starts off as expected:

    IP:192.168.0.2 Port:20000
    Blocking:False Timeout:0.0

and then loops:

    Try
    Except
    EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
    No data available
    Try
    Except
    EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
    No data available

In contrast to the ""nc"" call, the Python script *never* receives any data.

The ""nc"" tool shows the data really arrives, no problem at the source, no firewall, etc. So the recvfrom should catch something, at least about every other try, shouldn't it?

Q1: This question uses the dataset ""SPXVIX.csv"" which consists of daily adjusted closing prices for S&amp;P500 and VIX for the period of 2010-01-01 to 2018-06-29. Your task is to read the dataset into 3 lists named: date, spx and vix.

a) Instructions:- Open  and  read  the  dataset  with  the  help  of  a  file  handle  (introduced  in  Lecture  1),which are typically used together with base functions to read in datasets (i.e. do not use pandas to read in the dataset for this question).

\- When reading in the dataset skip any rows with missing data. Store the data into the following lists:- Convert the Date column into a list called date, each element of which should contain individual date (i.e. \[‘date1’, ‘date2’, ...\])

\- Convert columns with SPX and VIX into lists spx and vix respectively, each element of  which  should  contain  individual  adjusted  closing  prices  stored  as  a  float  (i.e.  for example spx to contain: \[float1, float2, ...\]) 

b) Next aggregate your lists into a single dataframe, such that date is used as an index(i.e. row names), spx data forms the first column (call it SPX), and vix data forms the second column (call it VIX).

c) Provide a docstring with the first 5 resulting rows of your dataframe.","Read a file and remove nulls, without using PANDAS",0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/rpt3qo/read_a_file_and_remove_nulls_without_using_pandas/,

Good morning. Learning programming is not easy. Python is one of the easiest programming languages, but still it takes months, sometimes even longer, to get comfortable with the basics of programming in Python. This is especially so for the ""self-taught"" programmers.

If you are looking for a good beginners' resources, I just published a book on programming in Python for beginners (on Kindle): ""Python for (Absolute) Beginners"" 👌

* https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M7P9WCZ

I hope, I believe, this book can be rather useful to beginning programmers in python. I put in a lot of effort creating this book, and if you have been struggling with python, it can give you a fresh perspective.

Also, I've been posting some Python code examples (mostly data structures, and basic algorithms) on Instagram. If anybody's interested, I can cross-post them here as well. (These example code is slightly higher level than the book covers. This book is for the absolute beginners, but it goes deep into the foundations of Python programming and can also be useful to more experienced beginners.)

I'm still relatively new to coding and I'm building a library management system for my project.

Now I have functions and classes setup for user login and registration

To run the code, is it normal to split functions up  
so instead of bulking everything into main() or home()  
can i break them down into other functions such as:

signin() - to ask users if they are admin or user, then run checks etc to login  
menu() - menu for asking what they want to do

Basically, the login and everything works fine

and Usermenu() if signed in as user.

As you know, in JavaScript Community they've got the two major package management tools - npm and yarn. These are, at least I think, really convenient in that you don't have to update the dependency list every time you add a new one. 

But in case of Python, I am now a bit confused.

As I have looked up several books(esp. from Oreilly on the topic of DevOps), most of them merely use requirements.txt and pip freeze for their container setup(Dockerfile). However, from Googling I have found there are somewhat similar tools with npm or yarn in Python - pipenv and poetry([https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/)).  

So, I wonder how you guys think of these tools, and may I ask if there is any 'best practices' for package(dependency) management methods or tools for Python development?","Is there any ""major"" or ""de facto"" dependency management tool in Python?",0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/rq057v/is_there_any_major_or_de_facto_dependency/,

I am making a game to study tolerance doses on python. The way I'm thinking it works is that I have a Table:

|Organs|One Third|Two Thirds|Three Thirds|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|liver|5000|4000|2300|
|spine|5000|5000|4700|
|brain|6000|5500|5000|

This table has 25ish organs each with three radiation dosages it can handle based on how much of the organ is being irradiated.

0,teledude_22,1637971051,False,"Hello, so I thought I really had the concept of for loops down, but I keep making an error that prints all values in a column for each row, when I just want to print the value corresponding to that specific row.

I will explain here in detail.

I have the following dataframe (df):

               Borough      Value
    ------------------------------
    0    Queens                44

    3    Staten Island         52
    4    Brooklyn              13

I want to write a for loop that iterates through each row in this dataframe and prints the ""Value"" corresponding to each row/borough. I simply want to produce the following

    44
    35
    22
    52
    13

I tried the following:

    for borough in df:
        value = df['Value']
        print(value)

which produces the following:

I then tried:

    for i, row in boroughs.iterrows():

I do not understand why the first attempt produces 6 iterations, while the second attempt produces 5 iterations.

You need to create a program that will save the user's favorite  holiday to a file. If the file already exists the user will be greeted  with a message stating their favorite holiday and asking them if they  wish to change their favorite holiday. If they do change it, then the  file needs to be modified. (See Refactoring--page 206) for the  try-except example on greet\_user). If they have never given their  favorite holiday before, then this information needs to be collected and  saved to file.

1 try:  
 2   holidayprogram = open('holiday.txt', 'rt')  
  3  favoriteholiday = holidayprogram.read()  
 4 print('Your favorite holiday is: ', favoriteholiday)

This is pretty cool. It seems to be ""joining"" the IDs in both `app_event.event_type_id` and event `app_event_type.event_type_id` and getting me the holiday\_name.

**A few questions;**

1. Is this actually performing a join using the ORM? If so, how does it know the type of join to perform? does it look at `objects.first` and use that to determine the type of join?
2. In the `Event` model, event\_type actually creates a db column called, `event_type_id`. Is this just so you can leave your variable named event\_type just so it is clear what is being referenced? (unless you use [db\_column](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/))
3. Is the point of creating the relationship like this to basically do the work for you and keep you from manually having to write joins in order to pull back data such as holiday\_name?
4. By default, django creates a covering index on the FK field which is really nice and if this is doing a join and querying, it's going to be fairly efficient.But when are you going to want to use a SQL View over using the reverse relationship between models?A SQL View seems like it would be more practical / easier a fair amount of the time. Just have a view model then pull it back with one line -  `view_object = View.objects.get(event_id=1)`.

So  I have been working on designing an algorithm to later implement to  create an excel sheet with web scraping from various sites. The process  my algorithm is going through is basing it from a .txt file containing a  lot of information which is formatted below, and then concatenating  only the link aspect of each line onto the String for the main site,  which is [mlb.com](https://mlb.com/),  and adding each String created into a LinkedList Object to make it  easier to traverse later to enter it into a spreadsheet. The algorithm  seems rudimentary and that I could design it better and could be  optimized later, but first I want to get it to work in Python.

The way the .txt file is formatted is based on hyperlinks from the [mlb.com](https://mlb.com/) website:

\* Fernando Abad &lt;file:///player/fernando-abad-472551&gt;  
\* Cory Abbott &lt;file:///player/cory-abbott-676265&gt;  
\* Albert Abreu &lt;file:///player/albert-abreu-656061&gt;

What  I would like to do is create a list of Strings containing each of the  various links to scrape each individual site for the player's name, age,  and hometown with each URL formatted as ""[https://www.mlb.com/player/fernando-abad-472551](https://www.mlb.com/player/fernando-abad-472551)""  to input into an Excel spreadsheet. Is there a way to format the .txt  file or the information within the .txt file to amend the String [https://www.mlb.com](https://www.mlb.com/player/fernando-abad-472551) to create the list of Strings?

Would  it be easier to go about creating a new .txt file with only the links?  Or is the algorithm fine as is?

So let's say I have the following code to achieve that:

            self.create_gui()
    
        def create_gui(self):
            new_entry_var = tk.IntVar()
            new_entry_var.trace(""w"", lambda event, index, mode: alter_entry(target = self.database['Peter'],
                                                                            value = new_entry_var.get()))

            new_entry.grid()
    
            show_button = tk.Button(self.master, command = lambda : show_database(self.database))
            show_button.grid()
    database = {""Peter"":22,

this does not change the database entry.

                                                                            value = new_entry_var.get()))
            new_entry = tk.Entry(self.master, textvariable = new_entry_var)
            new_entry.grid()

I then want to return matching values from a different column, which I'll call containercolumn.

In this tutorial, we will learn about **Virtual Environments**. As we work with different versions of Python, as well as working with different projects with different versions of python libraries, it is important to be aware of the virtual environments and to work with them. Therefore, here we will study the need for virtual environments and how to use them.

[Why virtual environments are needed?](https://deepblade.com/programming/python-programming/virtual-environments-python/#1)

[How to use virtual environments using command prompt?](https://deepblade.com/programming/python-programming/virtual-environments-python/#3)

## 

## Why virtual environments are needed?

Suppose we are working with a [Machine Learning](https://deepblade.com/category/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/) project using python. For example, we need the pandas library for that project (Pandas is a python library that can used to analyse data in Machine Learning). Then suppose we are using version **0.25** of pandas. Later we will work with several other projects. For that we have to update version **1.3** (Latest Version for now) of Pandas. Now maybe the project we did with pandas version 0.25 may not work properly with version 1.3.

&amp;#x200B;

That way we may have to work with different versions of python packages and different versions of Python. For that we can use **Virtual environments.**

## 

## What is a virtual environment?

We can create isolated environments for each project. These are called **virtual environments.** Then the packages and libraries installed within the relevant environment will only apply to that project. That way we can work with the environments that are unique to each project. Then it will not a problem to work with different versions.

The other special thing is there is no limit to the number of virtual environments we can use. And we can get clear idea of project dependencies for each project using virtual environments.

&amp;#x200B;

## How to use virtual environments using command prompt?

There are several ways we can work with virtual environments. Here we will learn it by using [**virtualenv**](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) 3rd party library.

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** You need to have python installed on your computer to work with virtual environments.

We can install **virtualenv** via command prompt (CMD) like we install other libraries in python.

`C:\Users\Deep Blade&gt;pip install virtualenv`

### 

### Create Virtual Environment

Now we can go to any directory and create a new virtual environment using below command in command prompt.

`C:\Users\Deep Blade&gt;cd Desktop/ProjectC:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;virtualenv env`

Where **env** is the name of the virtual environment we are creating. We can give it any name we like.

### 

### Activate Virtual environment

By now we have a folder named **env** in our current directory. It has a folder called **Scripts**. That is where we have to activate this environment.

&amp;#x200B;

First let’s go to that direction.

`C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;cd env/Scripts/`

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can activate **venv** using below command in command prompt.

`C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project\env\Scripts&gt;activate`

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can see this in command prompt,

`(env) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project\env\Scripts&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

This means that the virtual environment called **env** is now activated. Now we can do anything within this environment. And every library installed there belongs only to the activated environment.

Let’s look at the python packages that are installed by default when creating a virtual environment.

`(env) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;pip listPackage    Version`

`---------- -------`

`pip        21.3.1`

`setuptools 58.3.0`

`wheel      0.37.0`

Now let’s install another library and look at the installed libraries.

&amp;#x200B;

`(env) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;pip install numpy(env) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;pip listPackage    Version`  


`---------- -------`

`numpy      1.21.4`

`pip        21.3.1`

`setuptools 58.3.0`

`wheel      0.37.0`

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can see that the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library has been added to the packages. That way we can install the libraries and packages required for the project.

### 

### Deactivate Virtual environment

We can easily get out of the virtual environment we are currently working in as follows.

`(env) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;deactivate`

&amp;#x200B;

Then we can see the command prompt as it was before activating the virtual environment.

`C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;`

That way we can activate any virtual environment we have by going to that directory. It can also be deactivated at any time and exchanged between environments.

## 

## Bonus

When we are in a virtual environment, the libraries installed on it can be retrieved as a text file with their versions.

`(env) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt`

Now we can see that we have created a text file named requirements in the current directory. It contains additional libraries we used for the project and their versions.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, through this text file we can easily install the libraries related to the project in a separate virtual environment from the same version.

For that we need to create and activate a separate virtual environment. then we can install the libraries using the text file.

`(newenv) C:\Users\Deep Blade\Desktop\Project&gt;pip install -r requirements.txt`

Therefore, you should understand the importance of virtual environments. We need this a lot when working with multiple projects.

80,thegoddesses,1638025252,False,"Hello, I'm trying to navigate different versions of python. In my AppData/Local/Programs folder I have two folders: Python38 (with 3.8.5) and Python39 (3.9.2). I also found I have two executables sitting in that directory: python38.exe (3.8.8)  and python39.exe (3.9.5). Shot in the dark here considering I don't remember ever doing anything with these versions, but any ideas how I would have installed these python executables without the corresponding scripts, lib, doc etc. folders? I don't think anything depends on these versions so I can just delete them, but I want to understand how they might have gotten there in the first place and why you might want an executable without the rest of the jazz you get through traditional installation.

I’m using OOP, so most statements are defined in classes and/or functions. Here’s an example of my issue:

```
def userName():
    print(“Welcome! What is your name?”)
    user_name = input(“&gt;”)

# After many other lines, I need to reference the user_name in a separate function, likely nested in other classes or functions.

def OtherFunction():
   print(f”Your name is {user_name}”)
```

As you can see, I’m looking to globally access a variable that has been defined locally inside of a function. I know the dangers of assigning a local variable global status with ```global```, so what are my options here? Instead of nesting many functions inside of each other, is ```global``` an adequate option?

82,TastyHoneydew3,1638026567,False,"Hi all, this is kind of a Python question but also a more generic programming question. 

I am building a simulator app that requires defining relationships with other objects. 

For example, I am defining a rating where this rating is impacted by the rating of other complimentary objects (a positive impact) and then the rating of opposing objects (a negative impact). 

In some cases, the relationship is reflected back at the object, and sometimes not. For example, in many cases if B is a compliment of A, A is also a compliment of B. 

So I'm wondering what a good technique is for modeling this. I could just go to each object and define compliments and opposition for every object, but it *feels* wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I have the following data frame:  


    col1 col2
    
    gene1 id_1
    gene1 id_2
    gene2 id_2
    gene2 id_1
    gene2 id_2
    gene3 id_1
    gene3 id_2
    ...   ...

So basically I do have 2 columns with different gene names and IDs (in my case only 2 different IDs). Each gene can occur with any of those 2 IDs a different number of times, BUT its guaranteed that each gene has at least one time `id_1` and one time `id_2`.  


I now want to create a stacked bar plot for, let's say, the 10 most found genes. That bar plot (stacked) should show the share of each ID contributing to the overall amount of how often this gene has been found (Example: `gene1` occurs like 100 times, 40 of them is `id_1`, the other 60 are `id_2`; that's what I would like to see as a stacked bar plot).  


I tried a bunch of different methods but nothing seemed to work really and I#m a bit lost at the moment, like for example:  


    df = df.groupby(['col2', 'col1']).agg(count=(""col1"", 'count'))
    df = df.reset_index()
    
    sns.barplot(x=""col1"",
                    y=""count"",
                    data=df,
                    ci=None)

Does anyone has an idea on how to approach this?

***Problem***

In my script, its meant to only allow you to jump once until you land back down on the ground although im not currently sure on how to do this as when you click the jump button multiple times it will make you go higher multiple times instead of only allowing the script to run once untill it reaches the ground again.

I have a dict which comprises a map of values:

    correct_id = {\
                  'french bulldog':'dog',\
                  'orange':'not_dog'}

I use this map to replace values in a pandas DF:

    for i in correct_id:
        mask = candidates['breed_corr'] == i
        candidates.loc[mask,'id_corr'] = correct_id[i]

I'd like to change value in another column in each row, so I could add (for example):

    candidates.loc[mask,'other_col'] = True

within the for loop above. But this feels cumbersome and not ""Pythonic"".

Please tell me if there's a better way to achieve the same effect.

Taking it a little further, I'd really like to do the same here:

As you can see, rows are categorized by a certain ID corresponding to the ""Category"" column. So in this example there are 5 ""Categories"": ""1"", ""2"", ""4"", ""6"", ""8"". It does not matter that they do not increase by 1 for each category, so long as the categories are kept distinct. And so, you will see a patter, given that this is date chronological data, for each category, the value starts at 2, has some values in between, however many, and ends at 2. So each category has values ""in between"" values of 2. What I want to do is take the dataframe and remove the categories where between the two values of 2, for that unique category, where there no value that is &gt;= 10. As you can see, this would mean removing Category 1 (it has a 9 between the 2's), and removing Category 6 (it has an 8 between the 2's). Of course, there can be any number of values in between the 2's, but at least one of them must be &gt;= 10 And so I would want to produce the following dataframe:

    Date              Category      Value

    2015-06-08               2          2
    2015-06-09               4          2
    2015-06-10               4          5
    2015-06-11               4         12
    2015-06-12               4          2
    2015-06-16               8          2
    2015-06-17               8          6

    2015-06-19               8          2 

How can this be done in python? While I would think I would write a conditional statement that says ""if value in df\['Value'\] &lt; 10, then remove"", but I am not sure how to organize this based on the ""Category"" column like I mentioned.

The application within the environment is GuPPy, a scientific program used for a specific type of sensor. Its github is named guppy. I'll post the page in the comments. The files are being created on step 4 and it says they will be saved in hdf5. The step 7 is where it fails to load.

I've gone over the tutorial videos, but they lack any clues about the issue. Also, as an added fact, the videos include graphs that appear during the later steps, this does not happen for me. At the same time, I also don't see any errors appear on the cmd except on the last step.

I'm guessing it's something to do with the anaconda version? Might also be some random toggleable setting too.

They also only used macs in the videos and I use Windows They do have a compatibility setting for windows when I set up the environment.

(Now I had no intention of completing this course but recently we got a mail where the professors were accusing us of being lazy despite getting the opportunity of being able to access free resources so that kind of pushed me to complete the course. I just started python and I'm getting more and more interested with this stuff.)

Previously it asked to download Anaconda Navigator from where I had to upload ipynb files into Jupyter Notebook but now we started Python and some of the tutorials I follow on youtube look like a whole different interface (I saw one person was using Visual Studio Code and someone else geeksforgeeks.org and more) so I'm sort of confused. It looked like these programs could run more than one language and the course I'm doing didn't talk about this but I was curious and confused. 

Can someone explain if I need to get one of these and what these are exactly? And what softwares a beginner python learner should have on their pc?

I'm working on a project that runs a number of operations, with a few logging statements. I've got `DEBUG` if activated, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and hopefully no `ERROR`. Right now it's outputting to `stderr`.

The script will be running on a periodic basis and I'd like the end-user to receive an email with the logging statements organised by type.

I'm not sure how to handle this. I think that the closest to this in the logging library would be the [MemoryHandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#memoryhandler), but even that doesn't seem to match my needs.

So I'm thinking about subclassing `logging.StreamHandler` and storing every logging message in a dict {SEVERITY: \[list\_of\_messages\]}. Then, when the script is finishing, I'll send the email with the data nicely presented.

Is that the way to go?

i want to compute my eigenvalues and i want to order them for all of these 64 matrixes, however i dont really know how i should be able to get that. I do know how derive the eigenvalues for 1 of these matrixes (lets say i want to compute it for the last matrix (number 64) then i would do this:

sigma\_d =  M\[-1,:,:\]

eigenValues, eigenVectors = np.linalg.eig(sigma\_d)

idx = eigenValues.argsort()\[::-1\]   

eigenValues = eigenValues\[idx\]

     eigenValues = array([ 3.33361518e+08,  2.86860703e+07, -3.62047588e+08])

This works perfectly and the 3 eigenvalues are also sorted from largest to smallest which is what i wanted, but when i want to get a long list of eigenValues it doesnt work, what am i doing wrong? i tried to do this but that doesnt work?

       sigma_d =  M[:,:,:]
        eigenValues, eigenVectors = np.linalg.eig(sigma_d)
        idx = eigenValues.argsort()[::-1]   
        eigenValues = eigenValues[idx]

when i use the command below it nicely gives me the eigenvalues from all 64 matrixes in a large array.

    eigenValues, eigenVectors = np.linalg.eig(sigma_d)
    
    #i expected to get a long list of 64 of these identical arrays

        idx = eigenValues.argsort()[::-1]   
        eigenValues = eigenValues[idx]
    
     i get this:
    eigenValues = array([[[-3.62047588e+08,  3.33361518e+08,  2.86860703e+07],

53,RedbloodJarvey,1635365857,False,"I'm writing a script that manipulates text data so it can be read by Program X. Program X is strongly typed. I'd like to store the typed information for each field along with the value. 

I created dataclass `Field`:  

    @dataclass
    class Field:
        data_type: str
        sample: str
        index: int
        value: str

The `Field` class is then used by the `Record` class which looks something like this:   

    class Record:
        def __init__(self):
            self.Acct_Num = Field(
                data_type=""string"",

                value="" ""
            )
            self.input_file_name = Field(
                data_type=""string"",
                sample=""XXXX.YYYYYY.ZZZZ"",

                sample=""XXXXXX"",
                index=-1,
                value=""XXXXXX""

            self.Type = Field(

                sample=""XXXX"",
                index=3,
                value="" ""

For each `Feild` in a `Record`, the `data_type`, `sample`, and `index` are fixed, e.g. read-only. The information comes from how Program X defines it's variables to hold the field information. 

I never want them changed by the script. Only the `value` attribute of each `field` should be changed. An example code snipit:

    with open(input_file, 'r') as infile_fh:
        output_record = Record()
        output_record.input_file_name.value = input_file
        output_record.Type.value = ""XXXX""
        output_record.Acct_Num.value = infile_fh.readline()
        output_record.Category.value = infile_fh.readline()
    
The problem is people (including myself) keep forgetting to add the `.value` when assigning values to a field.  This is an example mistake: 

    output_record.Acct_Num = infile_fh.readline()

Python doesn't mind this assignment, until later when it tries to read the `value` of `Acct_Num` attribute.

I am working on a project that takes an image of a map and splits it into ""territories"" based on colors. It is meant to looks through an 8000x4000 (32M pixel) image and assigns each pixel to one of about 6000 territories based on its color.

I am trying to use a JSON file to save the map after each run so I don't need to re-analyze the image unless I actually need to update it. The problem I get when I run the program is as follows:

These types of assignment are the most difficult for me because I tend to think about what to choose wayyyyy too hard. I try to think of the absolute best thing to use when I probably should just keep things simple. My creativity is also not the best.

So the first part of the assignment wants me to model a class out of what we chose and then use a \_\_init\_\_ method along with at least two other methons and at least three attributes as well. We are also supposed to make two instances out of it. In the second part, we need create a specialized version with at least one other method, two new attributes. We also have to make two instances with it too. There's a third part that we need to add our objects to the list and iterate through the list and display descriptive information about each of our objects. 

I understand the instructions very well but I just can't think of something to model my classes of the will make sense for all three parts. The one I was working on before was easy for the first part but make the second part very difficult. Idk how I decided on this but I modeled pets before with information on the pet, owner, and it's species. I decided I could probably do something that makes a little bit more sense so I think I'm going to start over from scratch. 

So, what would you guys model for this assignment? I figured you more experienced python programmers could come up with a great idea to model my classes out of. Maybe one of you have already done a similar assignment and know what would be good to model my classes of. But anyways, thank you to who ever throws out ideas.

I originally was trying to think of it in terms of one parent can have many children.   Does ""parent"" mean the ""One"" case? Or the Child is dependent on the Parent?  Can I get some real examples with this? 

They say One to Many is 


~~~~

class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'parent'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    children = relationship(""Child"")

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'child'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('parent.id'))
~~~~

And Many to One is 

~~~~
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'parent'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    child_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('child.id'))
    child = relationship(""Child"")

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'child'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
~~~~

I understand in the first example, ""children"" is plural--- and attribute is a relationship.  From tinkering with SQLAlchemy, relationship attribute can be represented as a list of, in this case, objects of the ""Child"" table. 

But this second example, is it supposed to mean one Child object can have multiple Parent objects?  If that's the case, then my understanding of what ""Parent"" and ""Child"" mean are not correct. 

But then also, how could you refer to all the ""Parent"" objects that an instance of a  Child has? 

I'm guessing that ""Parent"" and ""Child"" have something to do with dependency but I would like more formal definition and real life examples.",Stepping back... reading SQL Alchemy documents- what even is parent/child?,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/pwa8jy/stepping_back_reading_sql_alchemy_documents_what/,

    while True:

I'm having an issue finding out how to get the string to fulfill the necessary tasks and still print in the way desired below.  


  
 

Write code that does the following:

1. Compute the number of words in variable *sentence* that contain either an ""p"" or an ""g"". Store the result in the variable *numPorG*.
2. Creates a string *strPorG* composed of those words in *sentence* that contain an ""p"" or ""g"". Each word in *strPorG* must be separated by a comma.

Print the variables *numPorG* and *strPorG* as shown below.

Do not double-count words that contain both an p and an g. Use the **in** operator to test for existence.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

sentence = ""python is a high level general purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems""

  
\##### My code below:

sentence = sentence.split()  
numPorG = 0  
strPorG = \[\]  


for word in sentence:  
if 'p' in word or 'g' in word:  
numPorG += 1  
strPorG.append(str(word))          


strPorG = str(strPorG) # I think this part is redundant   


print(""Number of words containing p or g is"", numPorG)  
print(""Those words are"", strPorG)

\#####

 Output I'm getting:  
Number of words containing p or g is 8

I need to load an Excel Named Table into a DataFrame. I've been trying all morning with barely any results. Can't find anything online that gives me an straight answer or solution to this.

I work a lot with Excel (PowerQuery/VBA) and thus all my files usually have A LOT of named ranges (tables, to be specific). I just need to load them into Python so I can keep using xlsm files that are already set up and working. Most of my tables don't start on row1, because I usually use the first rows as empty space for comments, remiders, things that are not useful data, etc.

Ideally, I'm looking for a code like this, preferably without the 'worksheet' part so I can reference the table by name only

Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I'm studying ""data science"" at present to shift my career from being a ""Business Analyst"" on paper (no actual ""business analyst"" responsibilities at my current place) to a Data Scientist by skill and profession. I still suck at it, but I'm enjoying coding and want to take it further.

At present I'm working through the Codecademy DS career path and in all honesty, I don't think it's a great course. There are a lot of gaps that the learner is expected to fill. For example, BeautifulSoup module in Python and web scraping, it's as if they want me to know HTML even though it wasn't listed on the course prerequisites.

I'm also going through the 100 days of code course by Angela Yu on udemy and that seems much better so far.

I guess I'm writing this to seek advice from those who may have gone through the Codecademy course or if what I'm experiencing is normal.

I tried solving this with an OBS script that passes up and down arrows off to the slides window do I can just leave the focus on the OBS window, do stuff and then still advance the slides whenever I want. I made where Everytime I push up or down in OBS it switches focus to the Google slides window, presses up or down with press_and_release from the python keyboard module and then switches the focus back to OBS. It works 90% of the time, with the 10% being when Google slides has a video embedded. When I reach a video with my script advancing the slides, the slides get stuck. I can't advance them anymore, I can't go back to the previous slide, and I can't pause or play the video, even if I turn off my script and switch focus back manually. The only way to fix it is to escape the presentation, and re present. I don't know if it's because the focus is only on the slides for a very small amount of time, or if the video makes Google interpret keys differently or something. So I'm wondering if there is another way to press keys, whether that's a different module than keyboard or a different way in the keyboard module, that won't make the slides panic and get stuck.

My current python code walks through the entire directory, finds all excel files, and writes the filepath to a csv file using Pandas and some other libraries. I need my code to periodically find new files/updated files and then update the Master List to reflect these changes. 

Example of my current Master File:

|Excel\_filepath|Modified\_Date|key|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Z:\\mypath\\Book1.xlsx|6/2/2020  11:11:45 AM|0|

|Z:\\mypath\\COG 2011 rates.xlsx|6/18/2021  8:41:02 AM|2|

Here are my initial thoughts on how to complete this:

1. FYI - I need to keep the key column consistent. 
2. First - run through the existing files in my current master list and check to see if a) the file still exists and then b) check if the modified date has changed. Based on the outcome of 'a' and 'b' I can create some lines of code that does other stuff.
3. After running through the current master list, I'll move on to running through the directory to find new files (files that did not exist in the current master) and write them to the example columns above with a new key (in the case above, the new key would start at 3 for the first new file found).

Here are my questions:

* How do I iterate through the Excel\_filepath column to check for the existence of the file and then ultimately the modified date?
* Lastly, how do I use the current master file to skip over files that I've already identified? (so that I can speed up my process)

&gt;  
&gt;def foo(a=\[\]):  
a.append(5)  
return a

&gt;Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: \[5\]  
. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):

\[5\]   
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(\[20\])   
\[20, 5\]

8,The__BoomBox,1630088526,False,"Ive been learning Python for the past 1 year, part from school , part from pushing forward myself to learn concepts the school won't teach/teaches too late like functions, OOP and so on. However, I am heavily handicapped by one issue - Properly understanding a new topic I am reading  


For instance, for and while loops which I now find simple. From what I've heard on the Internet, most people on average understand said topics within a single video, to a day or two at best. For me, it took 1-2 weeks or so of writing rough practice programs so that I could get the concept in my head. More or less the same issue with understanding recursions, took about....a month to get?  


Admittedly I didn't watch any video and instead stuck to reading which I am more comfortable with, and asking questions online to understand it. I faced the same issue with functions. Read up on it, tried working with it, the concepts didn't click for around a week or two, and it would take me much longer to understand keyword args, \*args, and \*\*kwargs  


I read up on \*args and \*\*kwargs so many times yet each time nothing I read made any sense (and even to this day I dont get the point of \*\*kwargs)  


Queue the exact same thing with classes. The concept took EVEN longer to click, this time even after watching quite a few videos on it. Even now, I might have trouble 'juggling' things in my head for programs I read and write (Say for instance, I define a class. I'd have trouble trying to comprehend whether some attribute is part of the class or of the instance in my head)  


Obviously, issues like this will heavily hamper my learning. I am now stuck on learning topics like PYQT5 and Descriptors ( latter topic I found just today). No matter how much I read up on them, NOTHING, absolutely nothing makes sense. Its one thing to get the concepts to click, and another thing to not even understand anything that is being said in the article

25,gradschool16hope,1630096021,False,"I'm a beginner at Python and I'm really not understanding how this project is supposed to work with command line arguments in general. I am using Visual Studio Code with a MacBook Air that operates on Python 3.9.1 for reference.

Here are the instructions: ""Say you have the boring task of filling out many forms in a web page or soft- ware with several text fields. The clipboard saves you from typing the same text over and over again. But only one thing can be on the clipboard at a time. If you have several different pieces of text that you need to copy and paste, you have to keep highlighting and copying the same few things over and over again.""

""The program will save each piece of clipboard text under a keyword. For example, when you run py mcb.pyw save spam, the current contents of the clipboard will be saved with the keyword *spam*. This text can later be loaded to the clipboard again by running py mcb.pyw spam. And if the user forgets what keywords they have, they can run py mcb.pyw list to copy a list of all keywords to the clipboard.

Here’s what the program does:

* The command line argument for the keyword is checked.
* If the argument is save, then the clipboard contents are saved to the key word.
* If the argument is list, then all the keywords are copied to the clipboard.
* Otherwise, the text for the keyword is copied to the keyboard.This means the code will need to do the following:
* Read the command line arguments from sys.argv.
* Read and write to the clipboard.
* Save and load to a shelf file."" (I tried to only include the important parts of the instructions as they were kind of long).

Here is the code that I have copied from the textbook:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    # mcb.pyw - Saves and loads pieces of text to the clipboard. 
    # Usage: py.exe mcb.pyw save &lt;keyword&gt; - Saves clipboard to keyword. 
    #        py.exe mcb.pyw &lt;keyword&gt; - Loads keyword to clipboard. 
    #        py.exe mcb.pyw list - Loads all keywords to clipboard. 
    
    import shelve, pyperclip, sys
    
    mcbShelf=shelve.open('mcb') 
    
    # Save clipboard content. 
    if len(sys.argv)==3 and sys.argv[1].lower()=='save': 
        mcbShelf[sys.argv[2]]=pyperclip.paste()
    elif len(sys.argv)==2: 
        # List keywords and load content. 
        if sys.argv[1].lower()=='list': 
            pyperclip.copy(str(list(mcbShelf.keys()))
        elif sys.argv[1] in mcbShelf: 
            pyperclip.copy(mcbShelf[sys.argv[1]])
    
    mcbShelf.close()

What I want to do is display the last X amount of games a user was in with the help of pagination.

A `Game` holds multiple `GamePlayers`, each `Gameplayer` is assigned a single `User`. What I'm trying to do is return every `Game` that a specific `User` is associated with.

Here's a very basic version of my `models.py` file:

    class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'user'

        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        username = db.Column(db.String(64), index=True, unique=True)

    class Game(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'game'

        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        gameplayers = db.relationship('GamePlayer')

    class GamePlayer(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'gameplayer'

        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        game_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('game.id'))
        user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))

I've had this working before by appending the games in a list, but I need to use SQLAlchemy to query the games so I may paginate them.

    recent_games = []
    games = Game.query.order_by(Game.id.desc()).all()
    for game in games:
        for gameplayer in game.gameplayers:
            if current_user == gameplayer.user:
                recent_games.append(game)

32,Pirellan,1630098418,False,"Hello, I am working on a tool for my work and one of the functions I'd like to add is the ability to take a screen shot of the primary monitor (or all if it's less finicky) remotely without logging in to the machine.  This is to let anyone with the tool know if a machine is in use before attempting remote access and disrupting anyone working on it but also to check various tracker boards we have setup that only display a web page. Sometimes these go down or get default browser prompts that block data we want displayed at all times.  Being able to take quick screenshots would (hopefully) be much faster than remoteing in.

I've tried to find if anyone has done this before but most posts seem to just be about the ethics of this (which is covered at my work, I've checked) or reference a 'Take-Screenshot.ps1' file that no longer exists at the linked location.

* create a global module/class in ClientInformation.py . This is accessed by a few modules throughout the test 

* not initializing it anywhere hence the issue.  If initialized in ClientInformation.py then it has no arguments since they haven't been parsed from the POST request yet.

* I believe it is thread safe since it's a singleton and I reset the variables in every @api.route(""/test_*"") and it is jus being run via simple cron jobs, one test at at time.

* How can I get the below to work? Currently, the get_access_token sees None for the ClientInformation._id , etc.
  
     * in ClientInformation.py, changing: cls.__instance._name  --&gt; cls._name does fix the issue but then it's not a singleton?


* another possible solution is to remove the class data, and just define them as variables instead of class attributes? But then I can't just pass *args* into ClientInformation and have to explicitly parse in each @api.route

My project consists of 60,000ish records (all Magic the Gathering Cards coming from a JSON file).

Everything up to this point was fun and is done. 

Then I'm going to store all that in an SQLite database on my disk. I plan to have a table with one record per card and the the ability to load that DB back to the original internal representation (list of Card objects) so I can do various things with it. 

My question is this: since RAM definitely permits, is it a bad approach to load all the relevant data to the database and from it?

The lab is about creating a program to determine the paint for a wall area.

Calculating the wall area (height \* width, obviously), gallons needed (area / 350 (number provided by problem)), and cans needed (math.ceil(paint\_need)) went smooth and easy.

The last step calls for inputting the desired paint color (red, blue, green) and then calculating the total cost of the paint needed, based on the earlier cans needed value generated times the color-specific cost of the paint. And this is where the chain of multiple variables has wrapped around my throat and is choking me out.

I have a text statement to assign wall\_color to the input provided (red, blue, or green).

I have created the proper cost calculation based on the given per gallon costs multiplied by the previously calculated cans\_need value.

Where I am lost is how to read the wall\_color variable and have it call the proper per gallon cost calculation based on the entered value (chaining one entered variable to another calculation based on that variable).

62,MezzoScettico,1630114057,False,"I understand itertools can make a huge difference in runtime for loops, but I'm struggling with trying to understand how to apply the functions exactly. I've been reading the documentation over and over and I've got some kind of block in trying to see how these structures are used.

Here's the core of the code I'm working with. It started out looking like this:

    for k in range(kmin, n + 2): 
        Q[k, 0] = P[k, 1] *  0.5 
        Q[k, 1] = P[k - 1, 0] + P[k - 1, 1] * 0.5
    
    for k in range(kmin, n + 2):
        P[k, 0] = Q[k, 0]
        P[k, 1] = Q[k, 1]

P and Q are numpy arrays.

This is a recursive operation. n is run from 1 to 10000. With the code written this way, it takes about 77 seconds to run.

Today I learned (seeing a numpy example) that you can write array expressions so you don't need the for loops. I'm not clear if this is a Python feature or specific to numpy. So the code became:

    Q[kmin:n+2,0] = P[kmin:n+2, 1] * 0.5
    Q[kmin:n+2,1] = P[(kmin-1):(n+1), 0] + P[(kmin-1):(n+1), 1] * 0.5
            
    P[kmin:n+2, 0] = Q[kmin:n+2, 0]
    P[kmin:n+2, 1] = Q[kmin:n+2, 1]
    

That made a pretty big difference. The runtime fell to 22 seconds.

So now the exercise I set myself is to see if this can be further speeded up by using itertools. I'm thinking maybe I use map to apply the recursion rule (first two lines) across each position in P. But I'm still confused about what that looks like exactly.

I also suspect that there's some clever way to use itertools to implement the whole loop over n at the same time. But if I should do that, I want to be able to capture intermediate results. The full structure is:

    for n in range(max_iterations)
        ...
        update array P
        if 0 == n % print_frequency:
            collect stats on P",Help with itertools,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/pd0k2i/help_with_itertools/,

64,Parlato_Butterfly,1630115420,False,"so what I'm trying to do is essentially, plot a graph of how having an irrelevant predictor z (of 20 dimensions) , together with x would affect the MSE. To visualise it, in each round *j*, *x* will be combined with *j* columns of z and then they will be run to find the optimal value of K and the corresponding test\_MSE. \[i.e. for round 1, z will have 1 col; then it'll run then next round it'll have 2.. until 20\]

Eventually, I will have to plot the optimal MSE against every j 

My issue is in the code; i have the code but every-time I re-run it, the value changes (for k and MSE) so I'm definitely doing it wrong somewhere when I compute it. However, I cannot seem to identify where it is.

Also I have an optimal value for every round but how do I store it before it gets re-computed?

67,dylannalex01,1630116096,False,"Hi! I'm finishing my Telegram bot which basically scraps free Udemy courses and send them to my Telegram channel.

Since the code is kinda big I have different packages: one for the database, another one for all telegram related stuff (tgm) and one last for the courses scrapers (udemy). 

The repository looks something like this:

    Udemypy
    |-requirements.txt
    |-runtime.txt
    |-udemypy
      |-__init__.py
      |-__main__.py
      |-database
        |-...
      |-tgm
        |-...
      |-udemy
        |-...

__main__.py imports functions from all the packages, scraps the courses and then sent them to my channel. This is run hourly from Heroku.

For not sending repeated courses I udemypy stores every new course it finds in a databse, and here's the problem.

After a while I have a database with bunch of courses. My idea is to remove a course from the database after some time it was found and stored in the db (like 30 days).

I I want another file that runs every day (but not hourly) which checks if any course in the database has been store for 30 days and delete them if it finds any. 

This new file only needs to access to the database package, so how should I implement this?
Should I add a file ""delete_courses.py"" in UdemyPy/udemypy which isn't needed by __main__.py nor run at the same time?

Should I move the code from __main__.py to another file ""scrap_courses.py"" and create the ""delete_courses.py"" file?

Or should I create another project for cleaning the old courses from the database?

The values under ""Select"" are referencing the values that are under the category number that ""Select"" shows.

I am struggling to find a good explanation of how to get around  positional argument problem for some homework. I'm not interested in someone giving me the solution, I'm just looking for some documentation to read on WHY its happening so I can fix it myself. No point learning it if someone else is going to do it for me right?

I have 3 python files

Application - calls my frontend and backend files.

frontend - provides a menu

backend - provides data storage and manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

FrontEnd and BackEnd work fine when they are together. When I run FrontEnd and choose exit I get my exit message and an Exit Code 0.  


When I try and run it via Application, the whole app works fine, but I get an Exit Code 1 whenever I try and quit. 

Application

    import backend
    import frontend
    
    class RatingManager:
        def __init__(self):
        self.__backend = backend.BackEnd(""ratings.csv"")
        self.__frontend = frontend.FrontEnd(self.__backend)
    
    app = Application()

Frontend

    import sys
    import backend
    
    class FrontEnd:
        def __init__(self):
            self.__backend = backend.BackEnd(""ratings.csv"")
            menu = """"
        menu += ""The rating app\n""
        menu += ""==========================\n""
        menu += ""[R]ate a thing\n""
        menu += ""[D]isplay ratings\n""
        menu += ""[S]ave ratings\n""
        menu += ""[E]xit\n""
    
            choice = self.get_str(menu)
    
            while (choice != ""x""):
                do stuff
            if (choice == ""x"":
                sys.stdout.write(""Goodbye!\n"")
    
    rm = FrontEnd()

&amp;#x200B;

Backend

    class BackEnd:
        def __init__(self, rating_filename):
            self.__ratings=[]
            self.__rating_filename=rating_filename

&amp;#x200B;

I have a whole bunch of other logic in my script which all works and I am happy with this.  


What I know

* Application passes the ratings.csv file to backend as a file to import ratings as a list.
* Frontend can create and save ratings to backend

What I dont know

* How this can be done just via Application
   * My understanding is that Frontend would not need to have backend set but i cant get it to work without self.\_\_backend = backend.BackEnd(""ratings.csv"")
* Why am I getting the below

&amp;#8203;

    Traceback (most recent call last):

        self.__frontend = frontend.FrontEnd(self.__backend)
    TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

  
I know it says I need a second positional parameter in the below

99,Turbulent-Bit-1193,1630149680,False,"I figured I’d ask here because I know that Python is a good language for scripting, and I think that’s what I’m trying to accomplish. 

I’m writing a textbook within four LaTeX documents which contain all sorts of “items” fitting the same general format: a prompt, possibly an image/diagram, and a solution. These could be used as end-of-chapter/assignment questions, examples within chapters, and one or two solutions.

Obviously I need a place to store this content, and I also want a way to *organize* it. With the exception of the images, everything would be in *.tex format. I know that TeX has the ability to retrieve images from a predefined directory while compiling to produce the document. I also know that my book’s items could be organized in many ways; which chapter/section the item pertains to, its associated learning objectives, difficulty level, etc. 

In my dream world, I’d set up an SQL database to organize the items, with some mechanism to allow the database to handle video files (I know there are workarounds for this), and write an API that allows my TeX engine to interact with that database during compile time. I could call the items by a unique identifier within the LaTeX code, and the compiler would retrieve the indicated content for that item (likely a chunk of LaTeX code, not certain about images). The content components retrieved would depend on usage. For example, something being used as an example rather than a problem would include a detailed solution, also having a brief solution to appear in the answer key if it *were* used as a problem.

The issue is, I’m neither a database architect nor a programmer. I have very good general knowledge of computers and databases, bu I’m something of a TeX newbie (although I somehow successfully used it in university -  I must have hit my head on something since then). I have some high-school level exposure to C++, and a semester of intro BASIC in my first year at uni.

So the question is, what’s the easiest way to achieve what I described, or something close to it? I’m unsure of the simplest way - whether a database is even needed, or if Python should even be involved - although I would be willing to spend a a week or two learning how to put this together if needed.

30,iyav,1627481215,False,"When using multiple sockets for what is effectively a single client, is it possible that `accept` will mix up the sockets on the server side?

Let's say a client uses 2 sockets, then to accept the connection it'll look something like this

    sock, address = server.accept()
    sock, address = server.accept()

No problem, we've just accepted the connection of both sockets and then the server can store them both in some object to represent that one client.

However isn't that too ideal?

What if two clients A and B try to connect at the same time. 

Can the connection requests overlap and they end up being accepted in the wrong order, resulting in socket pairs from different clients instead of the same one?

If so how can I avoid this?

Example dataset is working great, it has around 1000 images, and after 100 epochs I am getting loss at around 0.03 which is great.

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/rmmSf.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rmmSf.jpg)

I used the same workflow, collected around 1000 of them, named them properly and used the same code. And after 100 epochs I am getting loss at around 4.8 which is horrible. Program at test set is getting maybe 3% of characters correct.

I am wondering what exactly does it mean. Are my captchas more complicated and Keras therefore won't be able to read them at all, or I would need more (way more?) data to train this model?

Or I should use different approach? Maybe I should create more models, first denoising one (to delete those circles/ripples) and second one to read characters at image without noise?

I also tried experimenting with different values, neurons etc. Still I cannot get to what is causing such good results on first type of captcha and such horrible results on mine version :-/

`from greeting import Greeting` (without the `..`) vs. `from ..greeting import Greeting`.

I'm using vscode and pylint has no issues with either including the `..` or omitting it. However, when I run the program (`python3 main.py`), I get an `attempted relative import beyond top-level package` error whenever I include the `..` — does that sound right?

&amp;nbsp;

In my mind, since **greeting.py** is in the parent directory (i.e., above the **package** directory; same level as **main.py**), I would need the `..greeting` inside **person.py** to go *up* and look inside the parent, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  What I *think* might be happening is that **main.py** imports **person.py** to *its* level (also the same level **greeting.py** is on) and thus the `..` should be omitted.

I am in an intro to Python class and am having a bit of trouble with this part of the code.

An error message is supposed to be displayed when an incorrect input is typed. But it is not working as python is saying I need it to be in float or a different input type for it to be read. How can I get the error message to display? My professor wants to be able to type in ""1.5"" or ""xyz"" and the error message to display.

I've googled quite a lot to find the same error, but there wasn't.  
What is a numba type of `&lt;class 'type'&gt;` and how should I fix this problem? Thanks!

This is the full code of the function.

The types of input parameters are as follows:

epochnum: integer  
T: integer  
v\_pre: 2-dimensional numpy ndarray (shape: (1000, 784))  
v\_post: 2-dimensional numpy ndarray (shape: (1000, 10))  
lrate: 1-dimensional numpy array (shape: (2,))  
tau: 1-dimensional numpy array (shape: (2,))

    @jit(float32[:, :](float32, float32, float32[:, :], float32[:, :], float32[:], float32[:]), nopython=True, fastmath=True, parallel=True)
    def stdp(epochnum, T, v_pre, v_post, lrate, tau):
        timescale = np.array([float(i) for i in range(epochnum * T)])
    
        post_firing_instances_intmd = np.transpose(v_post == 35)
    
        post_firing_instances = np.array([np.array(timescale[post_firing_instances_intmd[postN]]) for postN in np.arange(10)], dtype=object)
    
        pre_firing_instances_intmd = np.transpose(v_pre == 35)
    
        pre_firing_instances = np.array([np.array(timescale[pre_firing_instances_intmd[preN]]) for preN in np.arange(28**2)], dtype=object)
    
        S = [[list(itertools.product(i, j)) for j in post_firing_instances] for i in pre_firing_instances]
    
        stdp_result = np.array([[sum([w(j-i, lrate[0], lrate[1], tau[0], tau[1]) for i, j in k]) for k in p] for p in S])
    
        return stdp_result

The official document of `len` does not guarantee to call `object.__len__`, while [`abs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=abs#abs) does, altough.

To be more general, special method names and built-in methods names are not necessarily same. As far as I know, `iter` can call an object's `__len__` and `__getitem__` to produce an iterator.

46,trondwin,1624870934,False,"Like most beginners, I thought list comprehensions were difficult to understand at first. But by working through it, it suddenly clicked. Here's what did it for me.

I imagined a society with a really primitive understanding of numbers. They knew one and two, and anything more than two would be ""many"". So given a list of numbers, how could I return a list of this society's interpretation? Here's how, using list comprehension:

    def one_two_many(nums):
        
        return ['one' if num == 1 else    # transformer starts here
                'two' if num == 2 else
                'many' if num &gt; 2 else
                'huh?'                    # transformer ends here
                for num in nums           # the engine
                if type(num) == int]      # the filter
    

I understand list comprehension as a normal for-loop (`for num in nums`) which acts as *the engine*, producing the initial values. On the right side of the engine is a *filter* and on the left side is a *transformer*.

The *filter* (on the right side of the iteration, or below it in the above code snippet) decides which values to process further into the list. So `if type(num) = int` only lets through values that are integers.

The *transformer* (on the left side of the iteration, or above it in the above code snippet) takes the values passing through from the filter and manipulates them to give the final result. In this example the transformer is a bunch of if-elses transforming integers to `'one'`, `'two'`, `'many'` or `'huh?'`, but it could be arithmetics or any other transformation, really. Note that the transformer must be able to handle any and all values that come through the filter.

Finally, using the square brackets `[]` is what puts the resulting values into a list.

The filter is not mandatory and the transformer doesn't have to transform (a valid comprehension could be just `[num for num in nums]`), but they are the stuff that makes list comprehensions powerful.

I'll end with an example using the function above.

    some_nums = [0, 1, 'one', 2, 2.0, 5, -3, 100]
    
    print(one_two_many(some_nums))
    

The filter will filter out `'one'` and `2.0` as they're not integers. Running the above prints out the list returned from the function `one_two_many`:

    ['huh?', 'one', 'two', 'many', 'huh?', 'many']

Hope this made sense! If anyone sees any errors in this presentation of list comprehensions, I would be happy to see it in the comments.",List comprehension,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/o9gfjl/list_comprehension/,

And...apologies for showing the full output, but I feel it is necessary to show the output for this issue I am having. 

Therefore, is there a way to list all 2038 unique values in my column, or extract them all?

I feel strongly about giving back to the Python community, as I started coding just over 20 years ago!

as well as

    ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(""./superdad.png""))

    superdad.png  ./superdad.png 

Actually, it does sort of 'work' but you just can't see the image.

I'm not getting any error messages and there is just a blank where the image is suppose to be. I tried uploading the image but it won't let me. For example, if the background is orange and I place the image on the upper left corner, the upper left corner would be white and the rest of the window orange.

The thing is that there are a lot of things he doesn't touch in his tutorials and I am incapable of finding answers to Tkinter questions with an OOP view. 

First question is: is there a book or web that faces Tkinter with classes? I have read that it's good practice to build a Tkinter app with objects but I don't see anyone (except sentdex and he is not the best) that explains how to properly organize an app with classes. 

Now, talking a little bit more about Tkinter, I would like to show some images and them let the user draw a rectangle and get the four corners coords I think I should be using canvas, place the image, draw the rectangle and then get the rectangle coords, is this a good approach? I mean, to use canvas, I've read that people recommend to use Label to display images but I've also seen some people that prefer to place almost everything they build in the canvas and play with it from there. 

And last, do you think Tkinter is worth learning for a summer project or should I learn other interface builder  like wxPython (which I really like it's aesthetic) or kivy (I read a little bit of its docs and seem super well written)

I am pretty new to python, mainly been playing  with pandas dataframes until now, but have just set myself a new problem - sorting my very messy downloads folder based on the file extension. I am using this code: [Organize-Download-Files](https://github.com/nitish-dev-1503/Organize-Download-Files) as it uses a dictionary for the file types by category and in testing has done exactly what I need it to!

I have amended it a little bit to create a directory where isn't found and added a few tweaks here are there - but I wanted to ask how I can make this code better:

* Currently the current automation.py file gets moved to code folder - how can I stop this? 
* is there a way to more effectively create the sub-directories rather than doing it line by line?
* Any other suggestions?

The most entertaining part for me is pouring over the economic data while I wait for my ~~gulags~~ construction offices build all my stuff. The game keeps track of everything from day 1 until present day starting in March 1960. 

There's *a lot* of data. The stats file for my save game has ~173k lines of stats and I'm only five years in. I made some cool graphs in Google sheets but this involves manually copying over data because I can't easily get it out of the game. 

I'd like to make a program that parses the stats.ini file and returns something more readable and I can use to make graphs and whatnot. I'm thinking an xls file so I can use it in Excel, a program I'm more familiar with. I wouldn't be opposed to doing this all in Python though if I can. I'm looking at this as a learning experience just as much as a thing I can do with the game. The stretch goal would be something like a simple website where players can go, upload their own stats.ini file, and then look at a dashboard type thing and see their nation's economic data with more graphs and whatnot. The parse should be able to let you pick data from any given set date (usually one day in each week of each month, from what I can gather so far. So, for example, I'd like to be able to create a graph showing steel production between July 1st and November 14th of 1962. It's all in the stats.ini file now (because you can create a table with it in game), I just don't know how to get to it. 

One issue with the stats.ini file, I get errors about there being no headers when I use the configparser module. I noticed when I opened the stats.ini file what looks like the [header] is instead ""%DESCRIPTOR_HERE"". I started to try and parse it myself:

As far as I can tell, the game takes a snapshot of everything every couple in game days and bundles them into sessions. So, my plan was to search for each bundle and then go through that and search for keywords like ""coal"" and ""steel"" to pull out how much was made during that period of time. I think that's the best way to approach it. The above is what I managed to do before bed last night. I'm very new to Python and I'm literally looking up how to do pretty much every step but I learn better this way. I can search for specific things but I'm having trouble getting the data after the keyword. 

In the above code, I'd like to be able to search for a keyword, get the line it's on, go to that line, read it, store the data after the keyword in that line in....a table? library? I really don't know, but just store it somewhere for later, then go on to the next one. The result should be a table for that bundle of snapshots showing production and everything else. 

So, finally, my question is, what's the best way to do this? I can't use the configparser and my searches haven't turned up any help with an ini file with headers with $. Here is a [github repository](https://github.com/Pequod989/wrsrparser) showing the stats.ini file and a picture of a table in game I'd like to be able to re-create out of it with the data I get from the stats.ini file.",I need help parsing a stats file in a game.,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/o9ngvu/i_need_help_parsing_a_stats_file_in_a_game/,

I also have ArcGIS installed, which is a mapping program that can make use of Python for model building.  Normally ArcGIS has nothing to due with Jupyter or Anaconda, and it was installed before Ananconda.  

In Jupyter,  I run ""import seaborn as sns"" I get "" **ModuleNotFoundError**: No module named 'seaborn' .  Running through github comments, I think that it is because Jupyter is only using the kernel from ArcGIS, which is geared towards mapping and analysis.  It imported matplotlib without issue, but 

 I can see that my only available kernel is below.

\* Available kernels:   python3    C:\\Program Files\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\envs\\arcgispro-py3\\lib\\site-packages\\ipykernel\\resources \*

How do I correctly add a kernel that - I suppose - would connect to Anaconda instead of ArcGIS?

In Jupyter, I use  \* !jupyter kernelspec list \* to get the available kernel above, what is the exclamation point syntax?  Something else that I ran into on github was  \* !which -a python \* which is supposed to tell me the default version of python.  But Jupyter returns the error:

\*  'which' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.  \*

I therefore want it to cycle through the files and copy values from a tab (they all have the same name) into another file. I am using openpyxl to do this.

So far I can get it to copy and paste values from one file to another, and I can get it to identify the next empty row, for a specific column, but when I combine the two together, it doesn't work.

My latest attempt (see below) is where I tried to turn the pasting into a function, and then call that function when my script see's an empty row. But it still doesn't work

    import openpyxl as xl  
    
    # open the source &amp; destination files 
    source_file = r""C:\Users\name\Documents\Automation_Tests\receipt_1.xlsx""  
    wb1 = xl.load_workbook(source_file) 
    ws1 = wb1[""Other_Data""]  
    
    dest_file = ""C:\\Users\\name\\Documents\\Automation_Tests\\hello world file.xlsx"" 
    wb2 = xl.load_workbook(dest_file) 
    ws2 = wb2[""Sheet""]  
    
    mr = ws1.max_row 
    mc = ws1.max_column  
    
    # create function to copy &amp; paste cell values from source file to destination 
    
    def print_values(): 
        for i in range (1, mr + 1):         
            for j in range (1, mc + 1):             
                # reading cell value from source excel file            
                c = ws1.cell(row = i, column = j)              
                # writing the read value to destination excel file             
                ws2.cell(row = i, column = j).value = c.value  
    
    # when finding an empty run, run the copy and paste function 
    
        for cell in ws2[""A""]:     
            if cell.value is None:         
            print(cell.row)         
            print_values()

1. I'd like to do some analysis about the time/date of when msg where sent but I don't understand if timestamp contain that information, because I can't seem to use it at all

    def read():
    chat = []    
        with open('') as f:
            for line in f:
                lines = line.split(' - ')  
                if len(lines) &gt; 1:

                        if len(lines2) &gt; 1:
                            speaker = lines2[0]
                            text = lines2[1]
                            timestamp = lines[0]
                            chat += [[timestamp, speaker, text]]

2. I've also problem with the part below: fFor what I undestood this say that if there is not speaker in the file then to not add anything else to add 1. But how can I edit this? like if I want to know not only how many emoji a user sent but how many emoji where sent in general or how many emoji where sent in a particular time/date?

    def totemo(request):        
        count = {}
        chat = fileread(user_ip)
        for c in chat:
            speaker = c[1]
            text = c[2]
            for char in text:
                if char in emoji.UNICODE_EMOJI:
                    if speaker not in count.keys():
                        count[speaker] = 1
                    else:
                        count[speaker] += 1

long story short I picked up programming (Java last year when Corona hit) but I decided to switch to python earlier this year. I'm startin to see some logic in this and feeling a bit more confident everyday.. The thing is I started to learn cause I love to solve puzzles and everything that is challenging physically or mentally. 

I lost my job end of last year cause of the whole corona situation etc so I was hoping once I know ""enough"" I wanna go for a job but I currently dont know where to go after im done with my current course I'm doing on Udemy.

I've always had interest in finance / economics and been investing whenever I had the capital for it. One of my goals (""dreams"") is to be able to create some semi automatic trading ""bot"" with machine learning or neural network (far in the future). Before I can even think about any of that I would like to have the skillset needed to land a job in this industry but I also know that knowing python alone is probably not enough for junior developer job or anything alike.

 So, I wonder if rtf wouldn't be easier to parse because of the metadata contained within the original google doc encoding.  Otherwise, I think the best way for me to approach the data to create a dataframe is to use delimiters, but that'd probably mean adding those delimiters by hand to a  long txt file.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I'm trying to use the metadata in the rtf as a delimiter.  however, I'm not sure that's feasible from what I've read of regex's, though I'd like to use this format, if possible. I think it will make my scrubbing less time consuming, and I think the rtf format could help me manipulate the metadata in different ways in numpy or matplotlib.  Further, I'm also trying to come up with some python to ignore the body text of the emails, and focus on extracting email addresses, dates, and some keywords I already added by hand.  Please help?

[According to the documentation](https://github.com/cjekel/similarity_measures/blob/master/docs/similaritymeasures.html) the function takes two arguments (exp\_data and num\_data ) for the data set, which makes sense. What doesn't make sense is:

&gt; exp\_data : array\_like   
&gt;  
&gt;Curve from your experimental data. exp\_data is of (M, N) shape, where M is the number   
of data points, and N is the number of dimensions 

This is the same for both the exp\_data and num\_data arguments. 

I have real data that I am trying to use, and can use with libraries like fastdtw and dtaidistance. I simply pass an array to the DTW functions in these libraries. It is just a list of numbers that can be plotted. 

The data cannot be passed into the DTW function of similarity measures in this way. What I am not understanding is what exactly the similaritymeasures function wants. 

Let's say I am comparing two arrays:

    s1 = np.array([0., 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0])
    s2 = np.array([0., 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0])

I cannot use s1 and s2 in this format in similaritymeasures, but it works just fine for fastdtw and dtaidistance. How exactly should these arrays be changed to make them work? And why? 

My reason for wanting to use similaritymeasures is that they have multiple other functions that I would like to leverage, such as Fretchet Distance and Hausdorff distance. I'd like to understand how to utilize it, but the documentation is not clear to me at all. I appreciate any help.",Anyone here use the Similaritymeasures library?

goal: buy stock and append to a csv file with columns: 

stock ticker,open price on buy date,open price on sell date,price bought,price sold,theoretical P/L,actual P/L, actual/theoretical%

now some of those columns i leave as ""NaN"" like ""price on sell date"" because i have sold yet.

so when i sell the stocks the next day i use pandas to edit the rows with the stock via 

`last_index = len(df) - 1`

`df.loc[last_index, ""open price on sell date""] = $5.00`

but i was like wait this is only for my last purchased stock because the csv appending i did when i bought stock keeps adding to the bottom of the csv file. so how do i change the index value so i can also update the data from for the other stocks i want to sell?

then i made a global variable counter for how many i bought the previous day and moved that to my selling function so it could iterate those changes via

`the_index = last_index - iterator`

anyway question is if you have a data frame with incomplete data values inside of it at the last 5-10 rows, whats the best way to update them?

    def my_function(foo, bar)  # Let's say foo = 10 and bar = 5
        new_value = max(foo, bar) / min(foo, bar)  # evaluates to 2
        if foo &gt; bar:  # True
            foo = new_value  # Now foo = 2
        else:
            bar = new_value
        return [foo, bar]  # Returns [2, 5]

If things worked like I wish they did, my\_function could be collapsed into a single line within the main loop of my program:

    larger_variable(foo, bar) = max(foo, bar) / min(foo, bar)  # Results in foo = 2

From what I know right now, only option is to just write a function that moves the if statement into a different function just so that it's easier to read, which doesn't really feel like a nice solution to the overarching problem of assigning one value to different variables based on some arbitrary criteria. Maybe variables are the wrong tool for the job?",Is there a way to assign values to different variables without if statements?,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/nn5xbi/is_there_a_way_to_assign_values_to_different/,
