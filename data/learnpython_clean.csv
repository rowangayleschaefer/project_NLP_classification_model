During some experiments I have come across some unexpected results. My apologies in advance if this was posted before . I have the following class:

            self.elems = elems
    
        def func(self, elem):

Then I run the following in the Python REPL

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyClass().elems)
    []
    &gt;&gt;&gt; MyClass().func(1)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyClass().elems)
    [1]

It seems like the third call to `MyClass()` is getting the values from the second line,  which I find puzzling. Shouldn't the default parameter in the `__init__` method initialize the internal array as `[]`? 

A fix is to pass the empty array explicitly during class creation, so I get what I expect:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyClass([]).elems)
    []
    &gt;&gt;&gt; MyClass([]).func(1)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyClass([]).elems)

I am confused about this behavior. I have been looking around but have had little luck finding answers. I believe that calling `MyClass()` should create a new instance?

I want to run a script that requires an emulator but I don't want to do it on my laptop as I can't do anything while the script runs or else it'll break.

Recently I've been working on a desktop client for my open source pastebin, [paaster](https://github.com/WardPearce/paaster). Basically all the client does is allow someone to assign a shortcut on their computer to automatically encrypt their clipboard and submit it to paaster.

I've been struggling with encrypting data in a manner cryptojs would understand (and concerned I would implement it insecurely.)

I did some research into how cryptojs converts data into a world array &amp; converts it to hex, but I'm stuck on how key derivation should work etc.

I'm more then happy to share the source code for the project with anyone (will be open source once completed).

Typically, an online store will have the concept of a “shopping cart”. In this problem we implement such a shopping cart.

Start from the file called [shopping.py](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS149/hw/hw9/code/shopping.py). In this file create a class called ShoppingCart

* Methods:
   * **buy** which takes one parameter – the name of the product the user wants to buy. It returns nothing.
   * **total\_cost** which takes no parameters and returns the total cost of everything in the list contents

Did it again with sudo, this time it worked but got, after a number of lines about installation, RuntimeError: Running cythonize failed!.

I didn’t know sudo could be used for Python. So the setup script needed access to a directory that it doesn’t have permission to open, and sudo somehow tells Python that the file is allowed for the duration of the execution of the command or something?

And why cythonize failed?

So what I get from it is,  you get input for the hex variable, use .lstrip to remove the hash symbol. Then you call a print to asnwer ""Rgb ="", a tuple (since I want three answers from one variable, I use a tuble that can hold multiple values), int() to convert the hexadecimal value to an integer. and then it comes the part where I got lost.

I've been learning programming in high school prior to coming to college and now I'm at a place, not just with Python, but with programming in general, where I want to focus more on building projects and less on tutorials and leetcode ""reverse a string"" type of problems.

I'm deeply aware that I'm still just a beginner and that I have a long way to go before I can call myself proficient and decent, but I think I'm ready to jump into projects, not just for myself, but for others too.

So far what I've done that involves Python is build a bookstore type of Flask app where you can take a book, set the time for when you have to return it, actually return it and there's a database set up with a list of books. I did this partly following a tutorial and partly by trying to figure out stuff by myself.

 Right now I'm making a chat app in Django, with Bootstrap being used for the design. Simple and basic stuff. I'm also interested in webscraping and I'd like to try to make a project based around that.

My plan right now might be to try to make a couple of more projects, post them on something like GitHub Pages, build a small portfolio of stuff that I've built solely myself, go on one of the freelancing sites and try to get a gig there. Aside from Python, I did make a couple of sites w/o backend so I'm kinda familiar with vanilla JS, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, apart from Git and SQL(PostgreSQL) that I learned when I did that project in Flask and rn in Django.

So what I was wondering is if there's a way, when this semester ends, to use a freelancing site like Upwork or Fiverr or any other site that you can think of, to land some sort of a gig for me to work on?

53,LemiZeg,1648846159,tu14vz,0,1," Hello Guys!

I've been assigned an interesting question by my teacher recently, and I'm having a great amount of trouble with this one. I would greatly appreciate it if someone may share their wisdom and explain how to solve it or perhaps show a solution themselves. Some background - my teacher encourages us to only use the python we have been taught, so there is much I still do not know and advanced methods I am sure I am not even aware of. If it is not too much to ask I would appreciate it even more if you could explain what the code is doing!

The Question is here;

* Write a program called *vertSort.py* that reads, sorts and prints *vertical* words.
* Input is read from stdin and consists of an arbitrary number of lines of text.
* Each line contains the same number of characters.
* Characters are lower-case or upper-case letters.
* Consider the block of text as a sequence of columns of characters.
* Output is the same set of columns sorted in increasing alphabetical order (ignoring case).
* Where columns are identical (after case conversion) they should be output in the order they were read from stdin.
* Your solution may **only** **import** **content** from the **sys** module.
* Your solution **may not** use the eval() function.

All of these rules are an absolute must in order to get the question correct. The link to sample inputs and outputs are here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/wJQM8yV](https://imgur.com/gallery/wJQM8yV)

I've posted this already in kivy group as this was originally related to kivy, but as i couldn't find the solution i'm trying here as well, as maybe the issue probably is not really kivy specific.

I have the following code, which creates some buttons and create assign them a text, looping through the a list of headers defined in MainMenuScreen class.

The aim is to have a function that when i click on the button, assing to decision\_to\_be\_made the text of the selected button.

To achieve this i'm trying to use the function testing, which is created inside the function create\_list

    class ModifyDecisionSettings(Screen):
    
        decision_to_be_actioned = StringProperty(""Select a decision"")
    
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):

                    button.bind(on_press=testing)

Lets say as example that in list headers i have values

    MainMenuScreen.headers = [a, b, c, d]

When i run the code, button are created correctly with the desired text, but when when i click on the button, testing function prints only value ""d"" even if i click on button a, b or c.

Can you please point me in the right direction ?

I do like flake8 (and any other code styler I've found), when it comes to almost all the other formatting tips.  but none of these code formatters/stylers have options to ""force"" it to acknowledge that my indents are ""tabs"" and they should LIVE with it.

Please spare me the stats that say most python devs use spaces, or most devs altogether use spaces.  They haven't been introduced to tabs properly or they are genuinly the type of people that without their ""IDE"" would press space (4 times).  lastly when it comes to ""rendering"" and re-rendering of indents spaces require your editor to ""edit"" the whole file if you personally work better with 2-spaced indents or 8-spaced indents.  while tabs can be ""rendered"" however you want without requiring to re-format the whole file...

31,devcultivation,1646233626,t52494,0,1,"Hi there. Yesterday, I shared my first post in this Reddit community called ""Deep dive into Python enumerate"".

Allow me to briefly re-introduce myself in case you missed it, or skip ahead to the paragraph below. I am a software engineer with 15 years of experience at small startups and large organizations.. From a self-taught background to Engineering Manager &amp; Lead. I enjoy mentoring developers, and want to help others level up in Python and software engineering.

Now, let's dig into how you can use zip.

\--

Zip is a Python built-in function to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel. zip provides a convenient way to perform parallel iteration over two or more sequences.

Take for example two separate lists of first names and last names. Assume the list of items are in the same corresponding order. Looping through a zip of the two lists makes it easy to pair the first and last name together.

    first_names = ['Tony', 'Carmela', 'Christopher', 'Paulie', 'Silvio']
    last_names = ['Soprano', 'Soprano', 'Moltisanti', 'Gualtieri', 'Dante']
    
    for first_name, last_name in zip(first_names, last_names):
        print(f'{first_name} {last_name}')
    
    # Output:
    # Tony Soprano
    # Carmela Soprano
    # Christopher Moltisanti
    # Paulie Gualtieri
    # Silvio Dante

Achieving the same output indexing into multiple lists using enumerate looks messy comparatively.

    for idx, first_name in enumerate(first_names):
        last_name = last_names[idx]
        print(f'{first_name} {last_name}')

The zip function returns a zip object, an iterator of tuples, which yields a tuple on each iteration. The 1st iteration of a zip object pairs together the values at index 0 from each iterable and so on.

For demonstration, a zip object can be converted into a list of tuples.

    result = zip(first_names, last_names)
    print(list(result))
    
    # Output:
    # [('Tony', 'Soprano'), ('Carmela', 'Soprano'), ('Christopher', 'Moltisanti'),
    #  ('Paulie', 'Gualtieri'), ('Silvio', 'Dante')]

However, beware of the edge case when the length of the iterables are uneven. zip will truncate the result to the shortest iterable ignoring additional items from longer iterables.

    last_names.append('Melfi')
    result = zip(first_names, last_names)
    print(list(result))

```
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
```

Looking at np.any and np.all, they are used to create an array of booleans values, and I am not sure how they could be used in the code snippet above. 

My second attempt uses np.where, using the method described here for comparing particular values of a batch of arrays by creating new versions of the arrays with values added to the front/back of the arrays. 

https://stackoverflow.com/a/71297663/3259896

In the case of the example, I am comparing values that are right next to each other, so I created copies that shift the arrays forwards and backwards by 1. I also use only the particular slice of the array that I am comparing, since the other numbers would also be used in the comparison in np.where.

    batch_ap = np.concatenate(
        (batch[:, 1:2+1], np.repeat(-999, 3).reshape(3,1)), 
        axis=1
    )
    
    batch_pr = np.concatenate(
        (np.repeat(-999, 3).reshape(3,1), batch[:, 1:2+1]), 
        axis=1
    )

Finally, I do the comparisons, and adjust the values

    batch[:, 1:2+1] = np.where(
        abs(batch_ap[:,1:]-batch_ap[:,:-1])&lt;2,
        batch[:, 1:2+1]-1,
        batch[:, 1:2+1]
    )
    
    batch[:, 1:2+1] = np.where(
        abs(batch_pr[:,1:]-batch_pr[:,:-1])&lt;2,
        batch[:, 1:2+1]+1,
        batch[:, 1:2+1]
    )
    print(batch)

     [ 8  7 10 10]
     [ 2 14 16 20]]

But theres a part about unit testing and this is where im struggling a bit. My ideia of unit test is something that runs parts of your program and sends the inputs and validates if the output match.

But how exactly do i do this when the inputs come from the console in a sequencial way ?

I have tried this:

proc = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

out = p.communicate(input='BEGIN\\n'.encode())\[0\]

print(out.decode())

But communicate stops the subprocess after its first execution and i cant send multiple inputs.

 Here are my questions:

1. Towards the end of the code, there is a getter **(@property)** and a setter **(@notes.setter)** for the **notes** attribute of a Student instance. getter returns self**.\_\_notes** but setter sets self**.notes** (without underscores). Why? Why does not setter also sets self**.\_\_notes**? *(BTW, the code seems to work with both self.notes and self.\_\_notes)*
2. At the very end of the code, an instance method is defined named **summary**. The method prints {self**.\_\_name**} and {self**.\_\_credits**} as seen above. Why are not they simply {self**.name**} and {self**.credits**} (without underscores) since **name** and **credits** attributes are defined as properties?

While fewer than 10 transactions have been added,  
For each active wallet on the stack, look up its last ten transactions and add their complementary wallets to a second stack. If they are with another wallet in the dataset, update the matrices. Otherwise, resize the matrices and update accordingly. Then, replace the second stack with the first, pop the second, and increment the counter.

When I've tried running this code, it's never getting to the final part. It keeps incrementing the same entry. I don't know why this is happening since in the main while loop body, there are only for and if statements which should only run once, not infinitely many times.

2. by using `sqlalchemy` as recommend by warnings from my other libraries: `UserWarning: pandas only support SQLAlchemy connectable(engine/connection) ordatabase string URI or sqlite3 DBAPI2 connectionother DBAPI2 objects are not tested, please consider using SQLAlchemy`

        with pyodbc.connect(SQL_SERVER_PYODBC_CONNECT_STRING) as conn:
            conn.autocommit = False
            try:
                if testing:
                    data = commissions_df.to_sql(""[dbo].[CommissionsDev]"", con=conn, if_exists=""append"")

                    data = commissions_df.to_sql(""[dbo].[Commissions]"", con=conn, if_exists=""append"")
            except pyodbc.DatabaseError as e:
                logger.error(f""Failed insert commission: {e}"".replace(""\n"", "" ""))

The first path, pyodbc, is the uncommented section. When I try it this way, I get this error:  


`pandas.io.sql.DatabaseError: Execution failed on sql 'SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name=?;': ('42S02', ""[42S02] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Invalid object name 'sqlite_master'.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this may be because pandas isn't designed to work with pyodbc, and I need the second path, using sqlalchemy... but I get this nearly meaningless error using the commented code seen above:

92,Wittinator,1646262916,t5d00z,0,1,"Hi there. I hope this won't be too confusing to explain. I am creating a simple XOR program in python. The user inputs simple plaintext which is converted to a string of bits. A key is generated of equal length to the plaintext bits, and it is XOR'd. I convert the XOR'd bits back to text and write it as ciphertext. This all works perfectly without issues.

The issue I am having is I want to take that same ciphertext and convert it back to its binary form in preparation for decryption. When I do so, I get a completely different string of bits. I'll try and give a reproducible example:

    import secrets
    import sys
    
    def encrypt(plaintext):
        binary_plaintext = [format(x, 'b').zfill(8) for x in bytearray(plaintext, 'utf-8')] # Convert Plaintext to Binary and separates into bytes in a list
        binary_plaintext = """".join(binary_plaintext)                                        # Take list of bytes and join together in one long binary string
    
        key = key_generator(binary_plaintext) # Create key of 'n' bits where n == len(binary_plaintext)
        ciphertext_binary_string = """".join([str(int(bit1, 2) ^ int(bit2, 2)) for bit1, bit2 in zip(binary_plaintext, key[0])]) # XOR Operation with Key and Plaintext
        ciphertext_binary_bytes = "" "".join([ciphertext_binary_string[idex:idex+8] for idex in range(0, len(ciphertext_binary_string), 8)]) # Split the Ciphertext into bytes
        ciphertext = ''.join([chr(int(byte,2)) for byte in ciphertext_binary_bytes.split("" "")]) # Convert Ciphertext to text
        print(ciphertext_binary_string)
        print(ciphertext) # Here we will have a string of characters i.e. ~ýÄÞ$~Ý
    
        decrypt(ciphertext, key[0], ciphertext_binary_string) # Pass the exact same ciphertext to the decryption
    
    def decrypt(ciphertext, key, previous_ciphertext):
        ciphertext_binary = bin(int.from_bytes(ciphertext.encode('utf-8'), sys.byteorder))
        print(f""Ciphertext Binary #2: {ciphertext_binary} does not match {previous_ciphertext}"")
    
    def key_generator(binary_plaintext):
        integer_key = secrets.randbits(len(binary_plaintext))  # Build a random key that is the same length as the plaintext
        binary_key = bin(integer_key)[2:].zfill(len(binary_plaintext))
        return binary_key, integer_key
    
    encrypt(""Hello There"")

Essentially inside the decryption() function I am taking the exact same ciphertext that was produced by the encryption() function, and just converting it into bits (This is before the application of the key for decryption, so the key can be ignore here).

To try and sum it up, I have: Ciphertext in the form of bits on line 8 &gt; convert this Ciphertext to text on line 10 &gt; pass this exact same text to decryption() &gt; Convert the text back to bits on line 17. At this point, however, line 8 and line 17 do not match. That is what I am trying to understand.

97,IHOP_007,1646266324,t5e5sb,0,1,"So I'm trying to make a script that automatically populates a .xml file that a program at my work uses.  Currently I'm running into problems around data types and I'm just not sure the best way to go about doing what I need to do.

**The Problem:**

I've got a large .csv file that contains what are essentially keys and values, where there are multiple keys (often, but not always) associated with the same value.  Simple example:

&amp;#x200B;

|Steve|Apple|
|:-|:-|
|Bob|Orange|
|Karen|Banana|
|Steve|Kiwi|
|Steve|Cucumber|
|Karen|Cherry|
|Chad|Fig|

    with open('TestFile.csv', mode='r') as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        mydict = {rows[0]:rows[1] for rows in reader}

to store all of the data in a regular dictionary, but I believe it's just throwing out data that has duplicate keys (for example: `Steve: Kiwi` is not stored because it's already got `Steve: Apple`).  I know you can store Lists as values in a Dictionary, as well as Tuples but I'm not sure how I would search for an existing value and, if it exists, add onto the list.

What I'm going to be doing with this data afterwards is populating a .xml file to where I'm going to have to search through the dictionary, pulling the Key and writing that plus all of the associated values multiple times.

I've never really dealt with data like this before so I don't really know the best way to go about it, hoping someone could push me in the correct direction so I don't make a complete mess of this.",learnpython,Not sure how I should store this data.

I'm creating an webapp in Anvil (https://anvil.works) that is linked to a Colab notebook and will write data from a form into a Google Sheet. I'm not hugely program savvy, but have figured out how to make the process work currently. I'm trying to make the next step work where other people can use the webapp and post data into the sheet (using the form), and I'd like it to be as simple as possible for the user. 

So is there a way to do so without needing to set up credentials or authorize users? For a bit of context:

1. I'm the most tech savvy person at work right now, thus the desire to keep it simple for everyone else. The other people accessing/filling out the form through the webapp would be professors and admin staff that just need to submit yes/no answers, 1-5 scale, and potentially comments (like I said, it all currently works right now from my end). I've figured out how to authorize my own account, but if I don't have to I would like not having to authorize others to use it.
2. The webapp wouldn't be shared anywhere else, only with particular people (no github or anything). There is the potential someone could figure out the link I guess? But then I'm hoping all they could really get access to would be the info stored in the sheet (which is pretty useless).
3. We have an organization setup, so maybe I could set it up so only people in our org can access it? But again, like number 1, some of the people we're working with would have trouble understanding that they need to use their org account to access it rather than a personal Google account (I'm telling you, they are not tech savvy).
4. Should I not use sheets? The main purpose for us is a shared file in the cloud that I and a few others could easily get to.

If there is a really simple way to resolve this I would be happy to hear it. I may have made it overly complicated as I was teaching myself from other's examples. I use gspread currently for writing to the Google Sheet and started going down the route of setting up a Service Account in Google Cloud, but also wanted to try using Google Sheets API instead (but also open to other options that would better work).

Thoughts:

1. Would it work to make the sheet public, and then I can avoid the credentials? Nothing personal on the sheet so if it gets ""out"" it would be pretty benign.
2. Do I need to setup and actual python environment and this is asking too much of Colab?

I found this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11849778/add-a-number-to-all-odd-or-even-indexed-elements-in-numpy-array-without-loops/11850097 but it doesn’t help since its not for the multidimensional case. 

My definition of an “even” index is that the sum of the indices is even. So the index (0,1,0) is odd since the sum is 1 and the index (1,0,1,0) is even since the sum is even and so on.

Can assume the total number of elements in each direction individually is 2, but cannot assume anything about the shape of the array otherwise. Ie, the shape could be (2,) or (2,2) or (2,2,2) or (2,2,2,2) and so on",learnpython,How do I get all even indices in multidimensional numpy array?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/sgpjcl/how_do_i_get_all_even_indices_in_multidimensional/

Highlighting key information
Writing down notes as I read the book
Making comments
Doing the small exercises throughout the chapter
Doing the end of chapter exercises

I am struggling to do something which seems so basic it is embarrassing. 

My macro program I've created needs a panic-key that the user can press to exit if the macro goes hay-wire. Obviously the common methods like CTRL+C do not work as the main terminal window is not active when the script is running.  


I've been *trying* to use pynput to accomplish this simple task: 

    import sys
    from pynput import keyboard
    
    def on_press(key):
        try:
            if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
                # Exit Program
                sys.exit()
        except AttributeError:
            print('special key {0} pressed'.format(key))
    
    # ...or, in a non-blocking fashion:
    listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press)
    listener.start()

But to no avail. According to the documentation the last two lines should allow it to listen without blocking the rest of the code from running. However, it doesn't seem to catch any input unless  `listener.join()` is added to the code... Which then stops the program and ONLY listens for key input.",learnpython,Struggling to create panic-key to exit python macro,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/sgq05p/struggling_to_create_panickey_to_exit_python_macro/
23,DivineSwine_,1643597531,sgqc2m,0,1,"Good evening, folks, I'm hoping someone can help me with an issue that's becoming really frustrating.

I'm attempting to access the Twitter api using the twitter package here -&gt; [https://pypi.org/project/twitter/](https://pypi.org/project/twitter/)

At  first I was using jupyter notebooks in vscode. When importing it the  red squiggly error line remained after installing with pip. And Pyright  said it couldn't resolve the import.  I've installed it inside and  outside of my virtual environment and also placed the script in each but  the error line remains.

At this point I wasn't sure if it was a VSCode or a Python thing. So I tried running it in command line.

All that was was installing it globally and running

    twitter --help 

exactly like it says on the above link, simple stuff but it comes back with this ImportError -&gt;

Traceback (most recent call last):

File ""/usr/local/bin/twitter"", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;

from twitter.cmdline import main

File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/twitter/cmdline.py"", line 101, in &lt;module&gt;

from .api import Twitter, TwitterError

ImportError: cannot import name 'Twitter' from 'twitter.api' (/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/twitter/api.py)

I'm really frustrated with it, when I run

    pip list 

it shows that the  twitter package is installed so I don't understand the error and hope  someone can help me get on the path to resolving the issue.

28,mackdaddy_1978,1643599716,sgr2va,0,1,"hello I need some help can't seem to think straight here. 

I have a problem where I need to iterate over a list of a unknown length of numbers for example \[1, 2, 3, 4\] adding each number to the other so it will be something like 1 + 2 + 3+ 4. This I can do with something like this   nums = nums\[0\]+nums\[1\]+nums\[2\]+nums\[3\]+nums\[4\] if I'm not mistaken. 

The problem comes in when the list is of a different size for example \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7\] how do I account for various size lists? initially I wrote the following code to accomplish the task 

    nums = nums[0]+nums[1]+nums[2]+nums[3]+nums[4]
    nums = nums / 5
    print(float(nums))
    

But this only worked for lists with 5 numbers if a list is introduced that is a different length the code crashes or errors out.

I have a function we'll just call func(). This function works by continually scanning a file and only ever returns the value foo if a specific element is found within the file it's scanning. In other words, the below code will only ever progress to process\_result once func() finds what it needs to find. Otherwise, my code is sitting around twiddling its thumbs.

    while True:
        foo = func()
        process_result(foo)

I have another function, func2(), that does a completely separate set of actions, independent of func(). What I would like to do is essentially keep running func2() indefinitely during this downtime. 

What I have tried thus far is:

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        while True:
            executor.submit(func)
            executor.submit(func2)

I'm coming across a problem where func() and func2() will both run once, but func2() will stop after the first run. I need to keep calling func2() over and over while func() is twiddling its thumbs.

 John   loves the game ""words from words"". The essence of the game is to make up many other words from the original word. Words may not make sense. New words have a length equal to the original word.

Example

From the word cat, you can make words: act, atc, tac, tca, cta.

It is necessary to write a program that counts the number of new words.

Input data format

A string of length N can consist only of letters of the Latin alphabet.

It is necessary to output the number of new words.

for light in lights:

    lights[light].saturation = ""any saturation""

Do a filewalk in a OneDrive directory, get a list of all files of a certain type, do something with them by iterating through that list. Pretty standard.

My go-to filewalk has been using glob recursively, and I've more recently started looking into pathlib. Both of these are giving me errors with 'File or folder not found', however. Not with all of the files in my list, just a small number.

example of my code, after changing my active directory to the parent folder:

all\_filenames = \[i for i in glob.glob(f'\*\*\\\*.{extension}',recursive=True)\] #glob

or

all\_filenames = \[path for path in Path(folder).rglob('\*.xlsx')\] #pathlib

What I dont understand is: why? Why can my script iterate through a list of say 1200 excel filepaths (full/absolute filepaths) that have been generated by the filewalk, but fail on a very small percentage?

Fills two different empty cells with a man ""Y"" and a chest ""B"". A man can move to a neighboring cell (cells bordering on the side are considered neighboring), and a person can also move a chest to do this, you need to stand in the cell next to the chest and push it away from you (go to the cell to the chest). In this case, the chest will move one adjacent cell in the direction specified by the push, and the man will move to the cell where the treasure was just located. All objects must be inside the rectangle. Empty cells ""."" may remain in the rectangle. The task of the little man is to push the treasure out of the rectangle, Bob indicates the exit from the rectangle with the letter ""T"". It is necessary to write a program that determines the sequence of pushes and movements of the little man, following which the chest can be moved to the exit (the exit is in an empty cell). Since the treasure is very heavy, the number of shocks should be minimal. If there are several optimal sequences, you should specify any of them.

Where the first line (2) is the number of test cases, the second line (3) is the number of items, the following 3 lines are the number of items (3 items so 3 lines), the first number on the line is the price (72, 44, 31), and the second number on the line is the weight (17, 23, 24), the next line (1) is the number of family members, and the next line(s) are how much each family member can carry (only 1 family member can carry 26), then it resets for the next test case and starts back naming the number of items (6) and does it all over again.

I think running the knapsack algorithm for each family member then adding them up will give me the correct answer but I can't figure out how to read the lines and put it in lists. I need an integer for the number of test cases, a list for the maximum weight carried by each family member, a list for the weights of each item, and a list for each price, the number of items (but I can get that from taking the length of the list of prices/weights if that's easier), and the number of family members (but again I can get this from the length of the maximum weight carried by each of them).

I'm not sure what the best way to go about this is so I was hoping somebody here could help.

I think I could solve this using the subset sum problem but wanted to double check if there's a way to do it with what I already have.

How do I get it to show which items they take?

Let me explain: on the above linked page, not far down there's a code block with examples and none of those are working. 

1. If I type as they do *from twitter import \** it tells me ""wild card imports from library not allowed"". How is that possible? I thought that's what wildcard imports are for. So I have to use simply *import twitter*
2. The examples make use of attributes and methods ('search', 'statuses' etc) that give me an error saying the object has no attributes/methods named {whatever} as below:

&amp;#8203;

    AttributeError: 'Api' object has no attribute 'search'

Which comes directly from code from the pypi site -&gt;

7,EsperCraft,1640967111,rsx6ja,0,1,"Hey all,

I've been trying to organize a single API wrapper for multiple services which are all accessible through a single access token.

The goal is to be able to have calls that look like this:

    import wrapper
    
    api = Wrapper(client_key, client_secret)
    
    api.getAccessToken() # return the access token
    
    api.a.Users() # make a call to the Users resource in service A
    api.b.Records() # make a call to the Records resource in service B
    
    api.getApiCallCount() # return 2 at this point

Here's the general file structure I've started with:

    /
      wrapper/
        __init__.py
        a/
          __init__.py
          a.py
        b/
          __init__.py
          b.py

wrapper/\_\_init**\_\_**.py defines a class ""Wrapper"" which is responsible for requesting the access token, beginning a requests session, and tracking the number of API calls made across all services.

    from wrapper.a.a import A
    from wrapper.b.b import B
    
    class Wrapper:
        def __init__(self):
            print('I am Wrapper')
            
            self.api_calls = 0
    
            self.a = A()
            self.b = B()

My confusion is how I'm supposed to organize the classes...

* Is it even correct to put this all in one module?
* Should I be importing serviceA and serviceB at the top-level of wrapper/\_\_init\_\_.py or within the Wrapper class?
* Should the classes for serviceA and serviceB inherit Wrapper()? I started here but don't think that's the right solution since the entry way is through Wrapper and not serviceA/B.
* Am I able to pass ""self"" to a child class? I thought this would be necessary to keep track of the API count but I wasn't sure.

Basically, I have a `Var` class which stores values (along with other metadata which is not shown), and a `Vars` class which stores a list of `Var`. The purpose of the `Vars` class is to sum the values in each of the `Var` in its list. I have found that if the summation is done using a for loop for each item in the list, it takes way longer (\~44x) than if the sum is done explicitly (i.e. if the number of elements is known at programming time-- see `sum1`). One solution to this is to use a `lambda` function (see `sum2`) to explicitly and dynamically write out the summation, which performs just as fast as explicitly writing it out without a `lambda` function.

Here is the output from the code:

    3140000005.7001 3.0798800999999996  # Summation in loop
    3140000005.7001 0.07164459999999995 # Summation explicit
    3140000005.7001 0.07178770000000068 # Summation with Lambda

So my questions are: 

(1) is this a general rule i.e avoid internal loops in PyPy?

(2) Is replacing the loop with a lambda the best option?

(3) Why is the loop so much slower?

13,jphlxix,1640969565,rsy23l,0,1,"Reposted from StackOverflow: 

I am in the early stages of retrieving IMDB data via the Python package IMDBPy ([their site](https://imdbpy.github.io/)) ([project github](https://github.com/alberanid/imdbpy)). I have been referring to [this nice IMDBpy implementation](https://github.com/erdeno/movietopia) for help with aspects of what I'm doing here.  Several of the queries that I'm using generate datasets that come in ""nested dictionary"" form, e.g. 'movie\_1':{'title':'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'director': 'Milos Forman'...}. My early version of the title retrieval takes this form in VIEWS.PY:   
`def index(request):
    imdb = IMDb()
    test_movies = {}
    for i in range(1100000, 1100015):
        test_movies[f'movie_{i}'] = imdb.get_movie(f'{i}')
    context = {
        'test_movies':test_movies,
    }
    return render(request, 'index.html', context)`

And this in my INDEX.HTML template:

`&lt;div id=""search-part1""&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    {% for k1,v1 in test_movies.items %}
    {% for k2,v2 in v1.items %}
    {% if 'title' in k2 %}
    &lt;li&gt;{{v2}}&lt;/li&gt;
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;input type=""text"" name=""search"" id=""search"" class=""form-control"" placeholder=""Search for Movies""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;`

Right now, the HTML is just to show that I *can generate a list of these titles. My actual implementation of the dropdown from the search bar (via [jQuery's Autocomplete](https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/)), is a little further down the road at this point. Here is an example that they provide of the Autocomplete in action, in the jQuery documentation:

`&lt;script&gt;
  $( function() {
    var availableTags = [
      ""ActionScript"",
      ""AppleScript"",
      ""Asp"",
      ""BASIC"",
      ""C"",
      ""C++"",
      ""Clojure"",
      ""COBOL"",
      ""ColdFusion"",
      ""Erlang"",
      ""Fortran"",
      ""Groovy"",
      ""Haskell"",
      ""Java"",
      ""JavaScript"",
      ""Lisp"",
      ""Perl"",
      ""PHP"",
      ""Python"",
      ""Ruby"",
      ""Scala"",
      ""Scheme""
    ];
    $( ""#tags"" ).autocomplete({
      source: availableTags
    });
  } );
  &lt;/script&gt;`

Essentially, at this stage, I want to draw up a massive list of all possible movie titles, and narrow that down based upon the first few letters that a user enters for a title search. Five or six of those need to appear for the purposes of the autocomplete drop-down underneath the search bar.

So, yes, there are a lot of moving parts to this. There is the slice of the huge, huge movie title database, which we filter out using the first few letters that the user types in. At some point, the var array that appears in the jQ section of the HTML needs to get populated with the values that will be shown in the drop-down autocomplete. I'm not sure how large that array can be within the HTML template before it becomes totally unwieldy, visually, or performance-wise. I don't know if these various components of a Django project can interact so dynamically, and quickly. I don't know if I'm taking a reasonable approach to achieving my goals with this stage of the project.

Any tips at all for the entirety or even a portion of what I'm undertaking would be much appreciated!

Edit: We haven't gotten to Ajax yet in my bootcamp curriculum. Guess it might be just the thing for easily/dynamically transferring stuff from a large database to the front end, eh?

Edit 2: Perhaps I should be trying to format the IMDB data, which comes as a dictionary of dictionaries, to JSON? Would that work better with the data translation?

14,RogerMas169,1640970490,rsyeiy,0,1,"I've seen ways of using the time.sleep() function, however that stops the rest of the code from running.

        success, img = cap.read()
        hands, img = detector.findHands(img)
    
        if hands:
            hand1 = hands[0]
            lmlist1 = hand1[""lmList""]
            bbox = hand1[""bbox""]
            cp1 = hand1[""center""]
            HandType = hand1[""type""]

            break
        
    
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

The problem is now that because of:

    print(length) 
    time.sleep(1) 

causing the frame rate of the video is reduced to 1fps. 

Is there a way to run the printing command so that it doesn't affect the frame rate?

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so I'm trying to get a button to open a separate file upon request using Tkinter as my GUI package. Here is where the main GUI stuff is happening, we'll call it File 1:

&amp;#x200B;

 *File 1*

from main import \*  
from passwords import \*  
def callback():  
 filename = 'passwords' + '.py'  
 os.system(filename)  
class mainMenu:  
 window = tk.Tk()  
 \# Widget Start  
 window.title(""Test Window Name"")  
 window.geometry(""250x250"")  
 btn1 = tk.Button(window, bg=""#bec5c4"", font=""Arial"", text=""Process Kill Button"", command=window.destroy)  
 btn1.grid()  
 btn2 = tk.Button(window, bg=""#bec5c4"", font=""Arial"", text=""Passwords"", command=callback)  
 btn2.grid()  
 \# Widget End  
 window.mainloop()  


File 2 is serving as the secondary file, which would ideally open a second GUI and all of its functions. As seen here is just the code I put in for it to say that it's working properly:

from main import \*  


class mainMenu:  
 window = tk.Tk()  
 \# Widget Start  
 window.title(""Test Window Name"")  
 window.geometry(""250x250"")  
 btn1 = tk.Button(window, bg=""#bec5c4"", font=""Arial"", text=""Process Kill Button"", command=window.destroy)  
 btn1.grid()  
 \# Widget End  
 window.mainloop()

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to have it go in order, so file 2 will only open only if its respective button is clicked on. Right now, both processes are opening at the same time, with File 2 being the first window that I see, and when I kill that process, then File 1 opens. File 1 will still open File 2 as expected if I click on the button, but yeah.

`'a' in ['a','b']` returns a boolean, in this case True.

So `not 'a' in ['a','b']` makes perfect sense, it is negating the boolean returned by the infix `in` operator, with `'a'` as the first argument and `['a','b']` as the second.

But if we write `'a' not in ['a','b']` then shouldn't python parse out `not in ['a','b']` and then throw an error since that makes no sense? Because we're using the infix `in` operator, but the first argument is `not` which is an operator and not a variable*

So why don't we get an error? Did the creators define `not in` separately as its own operator? 



\* I heard that everything in python is a variable, and I have been able to pass around functions like `int` before. Is it possible to pass around an operator like `not`?

My ask here is that someone be willing to schedule a screenshare with me to walk me through it, because I am at my wit's end with trying to figure out my issue, lol.

I imported the data frame, told Python which values were N/A, dropped N/A values, and transformed all variables to be binary. When I print the head of the dataframe, all of this was successful. I created new variable names (hivrate\_b, internetuserate\_b, suicideper100th\_b) to represent the binary variables. When I try to build the decision tree, I keep getting the error: ""Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: \[1, 143\]""

I have looked all over Stackoverflow and DataScience to find the answer and everyone says that the shape of my X and Y must be different, but when I print each variable they have the same length of 143. When I check the shape of the array, it is 143 x 7. I don't know how to fix this!

I have something I think should be very clear to me but I am having trouble understanding it.

Here is my code:

    ####
    print('########')
    
    for pig, cat in enumerate(dogs):
        print (pig, cat)
    
    ####
    print('########')

        print (cat)

Here is my output:

    ########
    0 Rocco
    1 Max
    2 Josie
    3 Barker
    ########
    (0, 'Rocco')
    (1, 'Max')
    (2, 'Josie')
    (3, 'Barker')

I'm so confused. Here are my questions:

1. If printing `pig` is producing the 0, 1, 2, and 3 output in the first loop, why do those same outputs appear when I only print `cat` ?
2. Conversely, why does printing `cat` in the first loop format differently, than when I print `cat` in the second loop?
3. In the syntax of the for-loop, is the meaning of `cat` and `pig` to python determined by the position/order? For example, when I switch the order to read `for cat, pig in enumerate(dogs):` I get the same result as though the order were not switched.
   1. What is being defined by the two positions in this type of for loop?

Hello fellow redditors!!!

I am hoping those of you that are skilled in python may be able to help me. I have a report from work that is generated every day. It will have a list of names that we need to send letters out to. The people on that list need to receive one letter if they are on the list for 10 days or more, 20 +, 30+ and 45+. Then finally one at 60 days. The issue is I want to make this to where there is no more human involvement. I want that if john smith was on the report at 11 days, he will be removed until he hits 20, then repeat for 30. However, he could be removed from the list. I am just not sure where to start and how to account for if he is removed.

The report is in excel, so the thing I am thinking is generating a new report after filtering with a python script.

The original report will look like this.

| NAME |ADDRESS|DATE|COMMENT|DAYS|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|JOHN SMITH| 111 MAIN ST| 01/01/2022| N/A|11|
|JANE DOE| 112 MAIN ST| 01/01/2022| N/A|23|
|ERIC BROWN| 113 MAIN ST| 01/01/2022| N/A|45|

Then the new report I would want to look like this

&amp;#x200B;

| NAME |ADDRESS|DATE|COMMENT|DAYS| letter to send|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

The only solution I can think of is to just have the program search through all possibilities until it finds a match for the keyword for the card played. 

The list of possible keywords would be huge, unless I could somehow limit the search for cards that are actually being used in the current game. The only way I could think to do this would be to make a distinct block of code for every possible match-up. I was thinking I may have to do that for the AI anyway.

Is there a better way do this? Like say if I play one card, how could I make that automatically call the appropriate function? I obviously can't store it inside the list for all that card's data. I can only think of giving it an entry containing a keyword, which then the programs goes through a set of elif statements until it finds a match for the keyword. There could possible be dozens though. Isn't there a better way to do this? It would be nice if I had a goto command like in Basic. That would make this so much easier. Just tell it to go to a line of code, and have that section of code end with a goto command back to the point it left off.

51,rdef1984,1641001407,rt8lu1,0,1,"I'm writing a class to manage password get/set using `keyring`. The aim here is to ensure that the password doesn't float around in the project any longer than necessary by using a `with` statement that deletes the password on exit, then sets it to `None`. I'm also unsure about whether `keyring` is the best library to use. It seems sufficient for this project, but I note that there are limits/security concerns in the related docs.

**Questions**

My questions are:

* after calling `del` on a variable, how long before the stored value is actually removed from memory? I've tried to search on Stack Exchange and the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=del#grammar-token-python-grammar-del_stmt), but the answers I can find remain unclear to me.
* is there a practical difference in terms of garbage collection between calling `del` and setting `None`? 
* Is it worth simply running `import gc` and then running `gc.collection()` after the `del` function?
* I've seen various suggestions that any `__enter__` statement needs to `return self`, but testing doesn't seem to make any difference that I could detect. What are the outcomes of returning `self` or (presumably) leaving the statement to  `return None`?
* Nothing I've read suggests that `return self` would be necessary for `__exit__` but I feel I should check in any case.

**Code**

It should probably go without saying that I am not a security expert (nor a python expert), and if you're here to copy/paste my password management code, perhaps realise that this isn't going to be the best code to go with.

Currently it uses `keyring` as an interface with OS password storage. I have a separate module that accesses and returns config file data, called `wc_config`, that stores local variables such as the app name and the username for the `keyring` interface.

The below case is exploratory, and I have further project notes at the end for those who are interested.

&amp;#x200B;

`import keyring, wc_config`

&amp;#x200B;

`class PWMan(object):`

`""""""Provides methods to securely store and retrieve passwords from keyring""""""`

&amp;#x200B;

`def __init__(self):`

`self.project_id = wc_config.get_proj_handle()`

`self.u_name = wc_config.get_admin_handle()`

`self.pw` `= None`

&amp;#x200B;

`def __enter__(self): # grabs project reference details, sets pw to None`

`self.pw` `= keyring.get_password(self.project_id, self.u_name)`

&amp;#x200B;

`def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb):`

`del` `self.pw`

`self.pw` `= None`

**Project notes:**

Most of the information within my dataset is publicly available. The majority of the data is effectively an internal market research asset of events and analysis of the events. 

What I'm seeking to protect access are internal and external email addresses, email send timestamps, and access credentials. The concern is not that email addresses or timestamps are secretive, but that my employer's data policies see these as personally-identifiable information - I'll be hashing email addresses with `argon2id`, while the timestamps and credentials will be managed with `PGPy` secrets accessed through the keychain password above.

70,JMoneyG0208,1641023231,rtej36,0,1,"Main Questions are at end of post...

I'm going over the Two Sum problem on LeetCode, and the optimal solution was to use a dictionary. This involved a ""look up"" to see if a dictionary key existed. Can someone explain to me how exactly python ""looks up"" a dictionary key to see if it exists. Particularly in comparing these two lines of code:

    # where n is a key, and d is a dictionary
    if n in d:
    
    # where n is a key, and d.keys() is a viewing object (a list??)
    if n in d.keys():

I was confused because these two methods took around the same time on leetcode, and I thought the second method would have a time complexity of O(n) because (I thought) it was just a list.

I did further testing with the timeit module... my code and its results are below:

    # checking time complexity of dict key look up methods
    # basically I'm running both methods and checking how much time each takes as the dictionary grows
    # I thought that the second method would take longer and longer as the dictionary grew, but that doesn't seem to be the case

Code:

    from timeit import Timer
    
    in_op = Timer(""x in d"", ""from __main__ import x, d"")
    key_method = Timer(""x in d.keys()"", ""from __main__ import x, d"")
    
    for i in range(1_000_000, 10_000_001, 1_000_000):
    	x = i
    	d = {i:0 for i in range(i)}
    	d[i] = 'yes'
    	in_op_time = in_op.timeit(1000)
    	d = {i:0 for i in range(i)}
    	d[i] = 'yes'
    	key_method_time = key_method.timeit(1000)

My questions are:

1. How does the first case ""know"" that the key doesn't exist? I understand when you try to access a key that doesn't exist, python gives an error, so I'm assuming that's the same mechanism?
2. If the dict.keys() doesn't return a list, then what does it return?

For my MSc thesis I'd like to backtest trading strategies on futures contracts. I've built a backtesting framework already but I think it's too rudimentary, especially since I want to include the project on my CV.

It works in the following way:

First I calculate entries and exit with simple vectors. Then I merge all the market data in a single df and add the column of 'Portfolio', thus getting something like :

Position {1} | Open {1} | High {1} | Low {1} | Close {1}| Position {2} | Open {2} ... | Portfolio

Lastly, I iterate through the rows calculating the # of contracts and changes in portfolio values. 

Everything works fine and the speed is (I think) decent. To calculate entries / exits and prepare the df it takes 10/15 seconds and the iteration part takes 3/4 minutes (this is with over 20 years of daily data and 20/25 contracts)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, looking at backtesters on github, I noticed that they are a lot more complex. Like they use a specific class for the portfolio and use specific functions for opening and closing orders (among other things). 

My question is: should I improve the way I handle the entire thing? Is there anything wrong with what I do from a programmer point of view? Is it ok to create big dfs and iterate through them? Is there any more efficient way to approach the problem?

To me, it just looks like an overly convoluted way to accomplish the same thing that variables and functions do. I mean, what's the fundamental difference between making a variable named 'playerdeck' and making some convoluted code just so you could instead type that as player.deck (or player.getdeck)? I was sorta thinking it may be handy if you had a huge number of variables that all must be associated with a huge number of other 'things'. However, yesterday I did this using lists without thinking about it. I even assigned index numbers to variables so I could easily reference which variable in the list I needed to modify. For instance, if I wanted to alter the cost to play a card, I could just type:

`card[cost]=x`

instead of the obviously less intuitive:

`card[4]=x`

This is functionally the same as making a variable through a class. I mean, all a class would fundamentally mean (as far as I know), is that this line of code would instead be:

`card.cost=x`

And that to call this variable, I would have to type in a different bit of code:  


`card.getcost()`

Also, I can put any data type I want into a list. Strings, integers, True/False statements, and yesterday someone on here told me a way I could even put functions in a list. I could even put another list in the list if I needed. What else could a class variable do for me?

Honestly, I see no reason I couldn't do things like:

`playerdeck=[]`

`computerdeck=[]`

Instead of something like this:

`class Deck:`

`def __init__(self):`

`self.deck=[]`

`def getdeck(self):`

`return self.deck()`

&amp;#x200B;

`player=Deck()`

`computer=Deck()`

`player.deck=[xxxxx]`

The process works and inserts my data. The problem is - I have a nullable date field that sometimes doesn't have data. When it doesn't have data, it set the value as `nan`.

I need to convert those nan values to a null. Typically this is easy and you can do;

    df.fillna('', inplace=True)

But I am actually converting my dataframe into a dict. If I use the above or  `df.replace(np.nan, '', regex=True)`, it isn't going to let me convert to a dict. Which is crucial.

How can I achieve both goals? Turn nan into null and convert my dataframe to a dict?

My trouble occurs with the logic behind deleting the first node in this segment of code:

            if self.head.data == value:

                self.head = self.head.next
                temporary = None
                return

I understand from online tutorials that creating the temporary variable is  necessary to handle memory, which is why I find websites such as GeeksforGeeks recommend this. However, in Python, is this any different than just doing:

            if self.head.data == value:
                self.head = self.head.next
                return

as seen in a different course I am taking (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Python by Udacity)?

    i = 1
    j = 0
    s = 0 #The sum of each vi
    
    def tri_wave(): #Generates 12343212343212... etc
    	global j
    	x = j #Get xpos
    	j += 1 #increment j for next time
    	m = 3 #Set Period of wave
    	return m - abs(x % (2*m) - m) + 1
    
    def q(v): #Question : How many nums from seq until their sum equals the index
    	global i
    	v = v + str(tri_wave()) #Add a new num from the seq to k
    	lv = [int(k) for k in v] #Convert each char in k into a list of ints
    	if sum(lv) == i: #Are we done?
    		return v
    	else:
    		return q(v) #Not done, let's go again!
    
    while i &lt; 30: #This needs to get to 10**14 !!! HOW !!!
    	v = q("""") #Answer
    	s += int(v) #s is the sum of vi + v(i-1) + v(i-2) etc
    	print(f'{i} --&gt; + {v} = {s}') #this needs to be mod 123454321
    	i = i + 1

You'll notice 10\^14, my goal, is slightly bigger than 10\^6.

I'm certain my solution could be more efficient, but I don't think this ""building up the sequence"" method will ever get me there unless I'm excited about hiring some cloud servers.

and here are the classes: [the code, without the ui etc](https://pastebin.com/Mf1Nu9T9)

&amp;#x200B;

The test asks me to load the data of the cars from a txt to a  ""\_\_carlist"" in the [ui.py](https://ui.py) file where than  

show the details of the car which is the fastest. when loading i initialized them as car objects, as this was we doing all the time. 

i can get back the topSpeed and so the fastest car from that but the rest of the details of the given car is hidden. 

i got stuck there, so the test was a.. you know.

Than at home i simply used the txt again and not working with the \_\_carlist which filled with car objects, and i was done in couple of minits but thats kills the game, so mission failed successfully .

Maybe i had to convert the cars to vehicle to get the data back? is it possible? but than the topspeed would disappear, as the uml was given, there are only 3 arguments, not 4, if not that uml thingy, i would simply wrote a getter if its private should be, and done.",learnpython,"how to get back attributes from a class when, the attribute(=0) and has no self.name?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/r6bwvj/how_to_get_back_attributes_from_a_class_when_the/

Im doing the 100days of code with Angela Yu and im learning about Pandas and Turtle on day 25

if i will ever need the basics of Pandas and Turtle when applying for my first job ever 

that guys post really opened my eyes  and i realized that i have very little knowladge of python even tho ive been learning for over 7 months i wouldnt even pass on one question from the interviewers , i know that im still bad at coding and im not even thinking about applying for jobs , i have problems with the really basic stuff like nested for loops or making a decent function or OOP , the question is :

Should i continue with 100days of code and  learning about pandas and Turtle or should i start with my own projects to seal my skills about the basics somehow , i consider myself a really slow learner or dumb , and very unconfident 

IF i continue with 100days of code I  heard that its a good idea to post projects from courses you do on GitHub  even if theyre simple projects is that what GitHub is for ? sorry for redundant questions im just unsure if finishing 100 days of code will be that beneficial coz further down the course theres also projects in Tkinter and i just dont know if thats something i will need when trying to get a junior job

21,11bcmn7,1638358663,r6cto3,3,1,"So I am having a hard time building a user function that will remove the two double quotes from multiple words when it is searching the string:

    Returns the first substring of s between two (double) quote characters and the double quote must be apart of a string.
    s is a string to search &amp; with two double quotes inside the string
    
    Example: first_inside_quotes('A ""B C"" D') returns 'B C'
    Example: first_inside_quotes('A ""B C"" D ""E F"" G') returns 'B C', because it only picks the first such substring.

I believe that I have the first part of function found by using the strip function to remove the two double quotes from the first example but when I use the strip function for the second example it will only pull out the outside double quotes on two separate words.

    def first_inside_quote(s):
        s.strip('""""')
        s.strip('""Your money""') returns 'Your money'
    
        s.strip('""Your"" ""money""') returns 'Your"" ""money'

I have a feeling that there is another part of the function that I am missing and potentially overthinking because I need the function to stop at the first set of double quotes, not the first and last double quote. I think I will need to use the find() function to get the search from stopping at the first space between the word but I can't seem to get that to work.

36,Ozymandias987,1638365633,r6euui,8,1,"Is this code ok? I feel like something wrong is going on with this code because of the nested if. It didn't feel right and in fact, to me, it seems hardly readable. I wanted the user to guess a random number and in case the number user types in is not an integer I wanted the program to say ""Invalid input"" and ask again instead of giving an error so I used the try/except statement. Then this happened, it works fine but doesn't seem right, feeling like there is a much easier way I can do the same thing but I can't figure it out. Is there anything wrong with this code? Is using nested ifs considered bad practice? And I'm a beginner so don't bully :/ Thanks.

I'm trying to implement a  bonus point system for inputs that are valid words but not the solution to the game (line 29). Can't figure out how to use the randomly selected word to refer to a list of valid words, e.g if the word is ""about"", I'm trying to compare the input to the list named ""about"".

Second, the 8 subfunctions of `search` (`D1,N,D2, etc`) are all similar with different if conditions and incrementation of `i,j`, and they are just procedures (no return statement)

It's not giving me any constructive feedback on what exactly is causing the error and I'm having a hard time spotting it since the program isn't really giving an error on juypter.

&amp;#x200B;

So for a science project we are importing temperature data from iButton dataloggers. The .csv-files look like this:

It starts with 20 lines of information

1-Wire/iButton Part Number: DS1925

1-Wire/iButton Registration Number: 2F00000010201A53

(and 18 more lines like that) followed by:

Date/Time,Unit,Value

15.11.21 23:00:09,C,21,188

15.11.21 23:20:09,C,22,5

(and so on)

Am I the only one to find this utterly moronic? Sure, I can use skiprows on the first part. 

But then the relevant temperature data is comma separated, with the last field being sometimes one, two or three digits. The header ""value"" accounts only for the whole degrees before the comma. My solution so far is to set the separator to "",C,"". This way I have only two columns (Date and temperature) and I can then replace the Comma with a Dot and treat it as a Float. However, this feels stupid and cumbersome and also it seems to interfere with processing the resulting dataframe (I get a ""multiple indexer"" error using iloc, but that might be a different issue).

Any better ways of extracting the temperature data as float in full? Am I right to be annoyed by the chosen csv-format or am I missing something?

In a perfect world, they'd stay that way throughout the project, however, once I start adding things to the code, things that will be part of the final project, it starts reading the signals as nearly-perfect multiples of 16, so

159-161

175-177

191-193

etc..

Without getting into too much detail, I want to create a check of sorts that confirms that the value being read is still likely (ideally) supposed to be a multiple of 16. I know there are ways to check if a number is EXACTLY devisable by another number, but that isn't quite what I need for this, I think.

So, my idea for this check is to have a list of multiples of 16, from 16x1 up to 16x255.(This is the part that I feel could be optimized the most)  

Then have something like 

(""list"" would be my list and ""signal"" would be the signal I'm reading)

    for i in list:
        if signal &gt; i - 3 and signal &lt; i + 3

If I'm correct, every signal that is read would be compared to each value in the list in such a way that it can check if it's a close approximation to each value by checking if it's within a range of + or - 3 of each list value.  


As I mentioned earlier, I feel there must be a better way of comparing a set of 255 different values than typing out an actual list of them. Even if I didn't type them myself by having python type them for me, I feel like it would take up quite a bit of space.  


So I'm curious as to what input others might have, maybe there's a better way to do this overall.

I have python script that crunches data, and makes a plot with matplotlib. There is a large set of data I want to visually compare.

It's not very important what the project is about, but in this section I'm just trying to create a simple Gaussian Mixture Model.

For that, I generate the weights, K being the number of different Distributions i want and D being their dimension:

`weights = {}`  
 `for i in range(K):`  
 `weights[i] = pyro.sample(""weight""+str(i), dist.Normal(torch.zeros(D), torch.ones(D)))`

Then I generate the scales:

`scales = {}`  
 `for i in range(K):`  
 `scales[i] = pyro.sample(""scale""+str(i), dist.Normal(torch.zeros(D, D), torch.ones(D, D)))`  
 `assert scales[i].shape == (D, D)`

after that, i want to generate my samples, N being the total amount of sample\_points i want:

`samples = {}`  
 `for i in range(K):`  
 `print(weights[i].shape)`  
 `print(scales[i].shape)`  
 `samples[i] = [pyro.sample('samples' + str(i), dist.MultivariateNormal(loc= weights[i], covariance_matrix= scales[i])) for _ in range(int(N/K))]`

The prints are just there for debugging. I get the Error 

`ValueError: Expected parameter covariance_matrix (Tensor of shape (2, 2)) of distribution MultivariateNormal(loc: torch.Size([2]), covariance_matrix: torch.Size([2, 2])) to satisfy the constraint PositiveDefinite(), but found invalid values:`

`tensor([[-0.3524,  0.4567],`

`[-1.0466, -1.0835]])`

which doesn't make any sense to me, since though the prints when generating samples i can see their shapes, which are

`torch.Size([2]) # weights[i]`

`torch.Size([2, 2]) # scales[i]`

So the error says it expects `torch.Size([2])` and `torch.Size([2, 2])`,  i give it exactly that but it throws the error about the shape being `torch.Size([2, 2])`.

I am kinda new to python. For university I have an assignment to build a function plotter.

I feel like I could lose a lot of time If I try this the wrong way.

Does anybody have some ideas or cool libaries, which can help with that?

According to the assignment, the program doesn't have to be able to detect every function,

I am young and fairly new to Python, and I have a question. It's pretty specific, so I'll try to explain it as well as I can.  I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to try and understand it. I'm trying to make a stock trading bot, and I ran into a snag very close to completion. Here the code:

`terminal()`

`def run():`  
`interval = input(name + ' | How often should I rescan? (type number of minutes) ')`  
`while True:`

`#part 1`  
`print('\n' + name + ' | Scanning for possible purchases...')`  
`buyscan()`  
`print(name + ' | Scanning for possible sales...')`  
`sellscan()`  
`print(name + ' | Scanning complete.')`

`#part 2`  
`p = multiprocessing.Process(target=terminal)`  
`p.start()`  
`time.sleep(float(interval)*60)`  
`p.terminate()`  
`p.join()`

  


(The target code is a function called `terminal()` that is endless input so that the user can type in a phrase (command). Each phrase corresponds to a small function that usually just changes a variable or something. The interesting part is that the function `run()` will be initiated by typing 'run' into `terminal()`. It will periodically scan stock market data, but when it is not doing so, it will be running `terminal()` so the user can type commands if needed.)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue:

Whenever I run this function, after the second part of the while loop begins (at code `p.start()`), it will start running any other code I have written in the file, and I cannot figure out why. One way I've found to stop this, is to change 

""`p = multiprocessing.Process(target=`terminal`)`"" 

to

 ""`p = multiprocessing.Process(target=`terminal()`)`"" 

But when I run this, it fails to terminate the process, and `terminal()` just runs forever. If anyone has a fix for this, or a better way to do what I am trying to do, I would love to hear it. Thanks again for anyone who takes the time to read this!

First I have an input called num\_players and I store these names that are inputted in a list. I then take in the number of holes to be played and create a nested list. The lists inside the master list represent the scores of each player. Each number represents the stroke for a single round.

    for count in range(num_players):
        name = input(f""Enter player {count+1}'s name': "")
        names.append(name)
    scores = [[0]*num_holes]*num_players
    

I then ask each player to input their stroke for a particular twice. The values have to match up both times. I then have to replace the zero in that particular round with the number of strokes they have.

&amp;#x200B;

    num_holes_played = 1
    while num_holes &gt; 0:

              num_holes_played+=1
              num_holes-=1

So let's say the name list has the values

    [""Player 1"", ""Player 2""]

Say there are five holes to be played, player\_1 plays 2 strokes in the first hole and player\_2 plays 3. The list should look like this:

    [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

However, the code I get is:

For example a friend of mine asked me to write a script for him to analyse log files of a few servers. this script actually will monitor an inbox which will receive emails with logs attached to it every now and then, and once it receives an email with a log file, it will analyse it for any errors, warnings and stuff and then add the data to a database.

Where do I start writing unit test for this project?

Another script I recently did is very simple. Here as well I am confused on how to write it.

This script will read a file from a path, and send it using SMTP to a specified set of emails. The contents of the file will be the body of the email. I have only a few functions.

    get_config
    read_file
    send_mail

Also I have init functions in all the manager files. EmailManager, FileManager and Config

So in this case where do I write the unit functions and what do I check for? I can share the code for this if someone needs to check this.

Hence, it would be correct to call the space as O(N) there as there cannot be more than N stack frames on the stack. To the best of my knowledge, Python has garbage collector and it entirely depends on that whether those stack frames would be removed or not. Would be happy if someone clears my doubt!

Hello,

i am completely new to programing, still typing out ""hello world"" in fact. but i have decided on trying python for my first coding journey. My goal for learning this is to help my self at work and also do a few little projects around the house in the future.

my idea is this, in my work ( mechanical designer) we take a lot of metric drawings, convert them to imperial and then build off that. so i want to automate that process. i want to take a PDF drawing and convert on screen (or generate a report), due to the fact there is a lot of other clutter or noise on the drawings i was thinking of having some sort of high light or lasso to show the program which dimensions i want converted.

Is this a reasonable project for python? or should i be looking at a different program? is this even doable? or am i biting off more than i can chew?

Thank you,",learnpython,Is this a reasonable project/goal?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/qkfmt1/is_this_a_reasonable_projectgoal/

You never know where a conversation between indie authors will lead to. A twitter discussion brought up giveaways that we indie authors tend to do. Long story short, the four of us ended up deciding to create **The Indie Python Extravaganza** bundle.

## Bundle link

The bundle is free to download till 31-Oct-2021: https://leanpub.com/b/theindiepythonextravaganza/c/pytober

## About the bundle

A collection of books that will help you to improve your knowledge of the Python programming language one page at a time. Join four indie authors in a journey from the basics of Python to the structure of production-ready systems, going through the core features of the language, some intermediate projects and a deep dive into regular expressions.

In this bundle, Mike (/u/driscollis) will teach you the basics of Python with **Python 101**. Sundeep (/u/ASIC_SP) will then take the lead and help you to put your knowledge into practice with **Practice Python Projects**. Learn what NOT to do when writing your Python programs with Rodrigo (/u/RojerGS) in his **Pydon'ts** book! If you need to learn regular expressions, Sundeep has again your back with his **Python re(gex)?** book, and when you are ready to start working on production code, you'll have **Clean Architectures in Python** by Leonardo (/u/lgiordani) to help you!

## Feedback

Hope you find the books useful in your Python learning journey. We would highly appreciate your feedback.

I'd like to thank everyone on Reddit and all the folks who have taken my course or read my programming books. I'm completely floored by the response I've gotten to this course. It's incredible and I feel so fortunate for being able to have such a large impact. As I write this, there are 999,866 folks who have signed up for my beginner programming course, so it looks like today, October 1st, 2021, will the day when I reach 1,000,000 sign ups. The vast majority of these are free sign ups. According to my metrics, only about 8% or so of students finish the course (about average for online courses).

But knowing that I've been able to teach roughly tens of thousands of folks to program really... gives me a satisfied sense that I'm useful. As Muhammad Ali put it, ""Service to others is the rent you pay for the room here on earth."" It's something I worry about a lot, but the number of people telling me they find my stuff useful is a great reassurance.

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: OCT2021FREE

**Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The subscription plan is free for the first seven days and then they charge you. It's selected by default.**

This promo code works for 3 days (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to OCT2021FREE2 in 3 days, and that code will work for another 3 days.

Some people in India and South Africa get a **""The coupon has exceeded it's maximum possible redemptions""** error message. [Udemy advises that you contact their support if you have difficulty applying coupon codes, so click here to go to the contact form.](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?type=student)

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month. [Meanwhile, the first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&amp;list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

Side note: My latest book, [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/), is out. It's a collection of short but complete games, animations, simulations, and other programming projects. They're more than code snippets, but also simple enough for beginners/intermediates to read the source code of to figure out how they work. The book is released under a Creative Commons license, so it's free to read online. (I'll be uploading it this week when I get the time.) The projects come from this [git repo](https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames).

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.

Is python the best language for building a basic trend type graph?

I need it to display a trend for different numbered inputs and display the day and time for each input as well. 

It also needs to be color coded for each data set so the numbers input in topic A would be a blue line, topic B would be a green line etc…

The last thing it will need is, for lack of correct terminology, the dotted vertical line that you can have appear by right clicking the trend and you now have full control of where that dotted line touches a specific point on the trend and displays that historical number etc..

Is this something a beginner can build from scratch or is it worth it to just pull the code from somewhere else and build upon that? I’d like to do it from scratch and keep adding to it as I need more items.

&amp;#x200B;

The code itself it's a class that handles SFTP connections (paramiko), checks if the files have been pulled already to an S3 bucket by comparing the content of two directories, and if not it pulls them.

&amp;#x200B;

A very basic pseudo code would be:

&amp;#x200B;

    class SFTPGrab:
        def __init__(self,con_params,s3_path,sftp_path):
            self.sftp_con = self.create_con(**con_params)
            self.s3_path = s3_path
            self.sftp_path = sftp_path
    
        def create_con(self,username,pwd,host,port):
            #paramiko creaes connection object
    
        def list_sftp_files(self):
            # returns a list of files from sftp_path
        
        def list_s3_files(self):
            # returns a list from s3 s3_path
    
        def get_missing_files(s3_file_list,sftp_file_list):
            # return missing files
    
        def get_files(self,missing_file_list):
            # pulls the files

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that according to the review (based on the principle of least knowledge) this SFTP class should be able to handle any other kind of file storage other than S3, which I agree.

I should be able to change the file storage, to let's say a Google bucket without having to change this class (the method s3 files is specific to s3).

Should I create a separate class for every possible type of storage, in this case for S3 buckets? The comments go into the direction of using an interface (ABC) and pass, for this particular example what would be an S3 class, that implements that interface.

I've been learning python from scratch and I am learning with ""Automate the Boring Stuff With Python"" book.

I am stuck at this problem:

 

""How would you write a regex that matches a number with commas for every three digits? It must match the following:

* '42'
* '1,234'
* '6,368,745'

but not the following:

* '12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)
* '1234' (which lacks commas)""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've written my Regex which goes like this:

digitsRegex = re.compile(r'''(  
(\\d{1,3})           # first number, either 1, 2 or 3 digits  
(,)?                #coma  
(\\d{3})?            # next 3 digits  
(,)?                #coma 2  
(\\d{3})?            #last 3 digits   
)'''**,** re.VERBOSE)

&amp;#x200B;

it does match all of the necessary numbers, however, unfortunately, it also matches the wrong numbers as well. For example result for the first number that is supposed to be excluded is ""12,"" and for the second one it finds '123' as a first group and then '4' as a 3rd. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions is: should I write some for in loop and and check all the numbers the second time or is there any way to exclude them from the regex that I am missing?

I'm only allowed to use 5 stops, If I'm not at my destination after 5 stops + 360 min I failed the race.

Hi Reddit,

I      have a Vue, Django integrated project. I hosted the Vue project on        Netlify and the Django project on Heroku. A python script   (integrated    into Heroku) is called on certain buttons which extract   data and posts        this  to the Django API to be viewed on the   frontend.

I have trained a font  type for my pytesseract OCR script. However, when i run it on Heroku, it  seems like i can only use the 'eng' (normal font) as 'language' for my  pytesseract image\_to\_string function. If I have the .traineddata file of  the font type that I want to use, how can I use this file within the  pytesseract functions? I can call the individual file, but I need the  right TESSDATA\_PREFIX as well. Does someone know how to deal with this?

This is something that will nicely print out `League: Graveyard of Ghouls, Follower Name: Arg` which is great. Now I want to give Arg a skill.

        gog.add_follower('Arg', AGILE)

I have it so that `gog.add_follower('Arg', AGILE)` will have the Name (Arg in this case) there due to it being a Unique Identifier and then have a `def AGILE` in class `League()` so I don't need to repeat whats in the `agile = print()` statement.

I also have the `def AGILE` to look like this 

    def AGILE():
        print('Agile - This character’s Dodge is increased by +1 die.')

with the \_\_repr\_\_ statement having `Skill: {AGILE}` instead of `Skill: {self.agile}`

In both cases AGILE gets an Error of not being Defined. If I have `self.agile` in the repr statement I get

29,nitrofire32,1630504515,pfudy5,0,1,"Hello,

Currently I am working on a project where 2 robots are placed on a floor, a master is communicating with the nodes, and the master is communicating with a PC. The PC is connected to a webcam which looks over the 2 robots. There is currently software in place which tracks the robot's location and direction, and very simple software that somewhat allows the robots to move to given locations (X-Y coordinates).

The goal of the project is to have the robots move to X-Y locations provided by me. The robots are to avoid objects on the floor, and move around them. Another plus would be to not have the robots hit each other, so they have to account for each others pathing.

Here is where my questions come:

1. I want to mesh the floor, and locate all floor that is ""Drivable"" and ""Obstacle"". The floor will be screenshotted from above, and can be considered 2D. What software or libraries are publicly available to me that could make it possible to do this for me? Perhaps some machine learning models pretrained or that I have to train? Please let me know what you can come up with.
2. When the floor is meshed, what algorithms can any of you recommend to me to create the pathing? Preferably also keeping in account the other robot's path. I was personally considering using Dijkstra's algorithm by putting nodes all over the ""Drivable"" mesh, somehow. Please let me know what comes to your mind.

I need to use split("" "") to make a new list to eliminate the extra blank spaces on each data\_point in each transaction. Makes sense so far, right?

Here is the ""solution"":

    
        transactions_clean = []
        for transaction in daily_transactions_split:
            transaction_clean = []
            for data_point in transaction:
                  transaction_clean.append(data_point.strip("" ""))
            transactions_clean.append(transaction_clean)
        print(transactions_clean)

This prints the new list, transactions\_clean, with no extra blank space in the data points.

But here's my problem. transaction\_clean (note the lack of the ""s"" there) has all of the stripped data points. But when I print transaction\_clean, **none of the data points are stripped**.

This is a problem because transactions\_clean *is just transaction\_clean appended onto it*. So if transaction\_clean doesn't show stripped data points when printed, then why does transactions\_clean show the stripped data points when printed??

    assigned a to b
    a now has 3 refs
    deleted object b
    a now has 2 refs

I was wondering why there were 2 references to the object 'a' after creating it and assigning it only to a single variable, the variable 'a' is the first reference, but I'm wondering where the second reference is coming from.

Also, will the garbage collection system delete the object immediately if I were to add

'del a'

Goal: Creating a command-line program that can automate and run processes different processes.

Example: I open the program and enter a command so that it gathers a bunch of data from an a couple API's and does some formatting and cleaning, imagine the whole thing takes 5+ minutes to do.

Problem: I want to run another command from that same program while this data fetching and formatting process is being done.

Main Question: How I can have python 'background' task 1, while I switch over to doing task 2 and then 'background' task 2 when I decide to switch back over to task 1, etc.

Almost like how in VSCode we have multiple terminal windows going like running React or Nodemon but can still do other commands too by switching between terminals (or splitting them). But in this use-case its all from one terminal instance/one program running.

Alright, full disclosure. I've done some programming stuff in C and in MATLAB, and I get systems. I just studied Aerospace not comp sci.

That said. I'm trying to do, what I'm sure is like the most primitive, basic boy thing anyone could ever do with Python. I'm literally just trying to get the ""Amazon Games"" integration for GOG Galaxy running. That's it. That's the entire thing I'm trying to do.

I'm using the only integration someone has ever made for this. A user named Rall3n over on GitHub. Project in this link: [https://github.com/Rall3n/galaxy-integration-amazon](https://github.com/Rall3n/galaxy-integration-amazon)

The issue I'm running into is that he's speaking in straight jargon. And I get that people who use Python understand basically everything he is saying, but I can't figure out any of it. I somehow accidentally got this working months ago, but recently had to rebuild my system. Upon doing so I'm back to square one.

If I try to google even the most basic stuff like ""how to build a package using pipenv"" I'm met with insanely long videos describing virtual environments and dependencies and on and on and on. Again, I'm sure this is all stuff Python users are super familiar with, but I genuinely feel like I'm sitting on a busy highway being passed by race car drivers and all I want to know how to do is like PUT THE CAR IN GEAR.

It has taken me 3 hours of just reading since I keep having to look up some simpler or basic foundational concept to even understand what I'm reading.  


Where I'm at: After 2 hours I have pipenv installed, somehow. I'm using Python 3.9. I have the zip file from the git hub page that will allegedly be used to ""build the package"" (whatever that means). I don't know what directory I should be in when using windows power shell. I don't understand how to pass args or even which commands are allowable since what was provided on the git hub literally matches nothing I see when I check help and look at commands for pipenv. I'm totally confused. Did Rall3n just skip over some steps?

7,IShouldSayGoodbye,1627869814,ow5aks,12,1,"As the title says, I'm having trouble iterating through a list and creating a new dictionary from it.

I am attempting to create a dictionary of rowing clubs and the races they attended, with the key value pair being the club name and an integer corresponding to the event_ID of a race. For example, a final key/value pair found in this dictionary could be `'Texas Rowing Center' : ['2', '52', '1005', '231']`, which indicates that the Texas Rowing Center attended races with event_ID's of 2, 52, 1005, and 231.

I am working from `masterdataset.csv`, which is a list of dictionaries with the following parameters:

`event_ID,event_name,event_location,event_date,clubs`

Everything is a string except for `clubs`, which is a list of lists; each list contains a club name along with some other identifying information, like location, number of entries for that race, and other aliases the club is known by.

Apologies if I'm not explaining this well, but basically I created a `set` that I appended all club names to. This felt like a good first step, since I'm iterating through a few thousand races and there are definitely some repeats. I am then trying to use each club in this `set` to determine if that club went to a race, and if they did, append that race's `event_ID` to a list. Once every race is iterated through, I am then attempting to create an entry in a dictionary, `club_attendance`, with that club, list entered as key:value pair.

Anyway, I'm running through this and just getting an empty dictionary. I hope it's not just something as simple as an incorrect indent... but I'm hoping to find out!

I'm not sure if anyone here will find this useful or interesting, but I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCti8KSLHdoVd7K0VZwUZk_g)  where I make Python tutorial videos focusing on Bioinformatics and  Computational Biology. I'm currently a Bioinformatics PhD student, and  I'm trying to share the material I learn in grad school with the  internet so that other people can learn these skills for free.

[For example, here is a video I just uploaded on how to make gene expression heatmap plots in Python.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJbxoyLZGwg)

[And here is an entire course I made on writing simulations of gene regulatory networks with Python.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWVKUEZ25V94kdT2Lh97KqB9MoLV9ZzmU)

Bioinformatics  is a really cool and exciting field to work in, and definitely a career  path that programmers should consider (even if you don't have any prior  biology background). I hoping my videos will help introduce people to  this field and learn some new, useful skills.

I'd like to INNER JOIN two tabels but I don't know how it works with SQLite3. My command and commands is working on this [website](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/7nJkvPDUHX2v3Hgc7v4fJQ/0) but if I try this on my DB Browser for SQLite or on my pythonscript with sqlite3 it returns nothing, no error or anything. What do I wrong? If I try just with one INNER JOIN it works but not with two in the DB Browser or on my sript :/

Thanks for your help.

TLDR: Two INNER JOIN commands don't work on python or DB Browser but it works on [this website](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/7nJkvPDUHX2v3Hgc7v4fJQ/0).",learnpython,SQLite3 command don't work in python (two INNER JOINS),1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/owatla/sqlite3_command_dont_work_in_python_two_inner/

{'Brand': \['Connoisseurs'\],'Model Number': \['738'\], 'Product Dimensions': \['20 x 11 x 2.5 cm; 1 Grams'\], 'Item Weight': \['1 g'\], 'Colour': \['Silver'\]}

The API comes back saying i need to add Type, great it know it works. But when  add type and i do this like this:-

complete\['Type'\] = \['Does not apply'\]

i know get : {'Brand': \['Connoisseurs'\], 'Type': \['Does not apply'\], 'Model Number': \['738'\], 'Product Dimensions': \['20 x 11 x 2.5 cm; 1 Grams'\], 'Item Weight': \['1 g'\], 'Colour': \['Silver'\]}

I wanted to add plots to GraphicsLayoutWidget. However i tried with the code i have written which is below.

But now i wanted to changed i have two types of msgs one in live mode and in other recorded mode. However i wanted to add one more plot item in live mode.

To be sure i also added some comments in the code to get some understanding for you.I only pasted some part of the code.

I searched already in stack and reddit but couldnt find answers which solves my thing.

I currently have a data set that I have attempted to resample them using pandas such that a data point is given every second.

However, when I compare this resampled data to my original data set, I  am noticing gaps in my data when I look at small time scales, or when sudden changes in my data occur. I don't want these gaps to be present since I wish to perform a FFT on my data set to convert it from the time domain to the frequency domain, and these gaps would harm the transformation. Why do these gaps occur and how can I remove them?

47,ChazzFingers,1627908673,owduii,11,1,"Hey everyone,

I'm having a problem that should be really simply but for some reason I cannot figure it out. Basically, I have a data frame that looks like this:

|*index*|*response*|*num\_var1*|num\_var2|num\_var3|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|user1|A|3|0|0|
|user2|A|5|0|5|
|user3|B|0|1|10|
|user4|A|5|5|0|

I want to remove all column (the sum of column *num\_var1* would be 3 + 5 + 5 = 13, the sum of row *user1* would be 3) and to repeat this process until the dataset is 'stable'

I've provided the following pseudocode to make it more clear. 

    repeat:
        old_size = data.size
        data := data with all columns that sum to &lt;= 50 removed 
        data := data with all rows that sum to &lt;= 50 removed
        
        if data.size = old_size: break loop

The problem I'm having is removing all columns/rows that sum to less than or equal to 50 at any given iteration of the loop. I've tried some suggestions from stack overflow, i.e.:

    data.drop(data.columns[data.sum(numeric_only = True) &lt;= 50], axis = 'columns', inplace=True)

However the issue is with the fact that \[data.sum(numeric\_only = True) &lt;= 50\] returns a vector that is shorter than the vector containing the column names because the numeric\_only = True argument ignores the 'response' column. However, leaving the numeric\_only argument empty leads to an error because 'string &lt;= 50' can't be evaluated. 

I've looked extensively but can't find anything helpful - every example of dropping columns based on their sum assumes an entirely numerical dataset.

I've also tried this:

    while True:
      print('in: '+str(data.shape))  
      size = data.size 
      bad_cols = [col for col in data.columns[1:] if data[col].sum() &lt;= 50]
      bad_rows = [row for row in data.index if data.loc[[row]].sum(axis=1, numeric_only = True)[0] &lt;= 50]
      data.drop(bad_cols , axis = 'columns', inplace=True)
      data.drop(bad_rows, axis = 'rows', inplace = True)
      print('out: '+str(data.shape))    
      if data.size == size:
          break

But the list comprehension is insanely slow to the point that it is not practical.

Any and all tips would be greatly appreciated!

As a dominantly visual person, I've often thought about how convenient it would be to be able to build up the framework for an application in a tool that incorporated a visually interface, sort of like crating a flow chart:  In a visual interface, drop blocks onto the UI, connect them together, label them, and have that available in a code editor to do whatever fine grained stuff.   Conversely, open an existing application in this tool and it would provide the same flowchart-like visual representation of it.

Does any such thing exist?

Also, slightly tangental, is a linter something you'd use to find superfluous code?  For example, unused variables?  Currently my IDE is VS Code and it does have all sorts of linter extensions that I will poke around with, but figured I'd ask here while I was at it.",learnpython,flowchart-like visual IDEs?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/oweawq/flowchartlike_visual_ides/

I am creating a desktop App using tkinter. The app has multiple pages, and there are pages that has common features (widgets, functions, backend structure, etc…). So now what I am doing is, creating a main class that has the container geometry, shared data and looping over each page to be loaded and displayed.

```py
class tkinterApp(tk.Tk):
    # __init__ function for class tkinterApp
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        # __init__ function for class Tk
        tk.Tk.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

        self.shared_data = {....}
        self.geometry(""1250x600"")

        # initializing frames to an empty array
        self.frames = {}

        for F in (StartPage, Page1,Page2,...):
            frame = F(container, self)
            self.frames[F] = frame
        self.show_frame(StartPage)

    def show_frame(self, cont):
        frame = self.frames[cont]
        frame.tkraise()
```

Then the next thing in mind is to create the structure as below:
1. Class (Page) that has the main page structure
2. A new class for each group of pages that have common characteristics (Group1, Group2). Each class of those are inherited from (Page) class.
3. Create the final pages that ought to be displayed. Each are inherited from the related group class.
4. There are also a class (CommonParams) that contains the common parameters and methods that can be used across all over other classes. Which means a class can inherit multiple classes.

Am I thinking it in the right way? As, I come across situations in which I need to define multiple instances of the methods in (CommonParams) class.

* sys.modules  needs to be updated manually. Care must be taken, as it needs to be  modified before exec\_module() to allow relative imports, and that must  be undone if exception occurs while executing it.
* the parent package needs to be setattr()-ed, otherwise it will break regular code such as:

90,bdlc2019,1627930539,owl6t0,0,1,"Dear Hivemind,

Sorry for the long post but I'm experiencing some difficulties with multiprocessing in Python. Using the snippet below I'm getting two errors:

    AttributeError: 'ForkAwareLocal' object has no attribute 'connection'

and

    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

I've found that this is because the main process closes earlier than the sub-processes causing the subprocesses to be discarded, throwing these errors. I'm using \`p.join()\` as this should keep the main process waiting until the current process is done (if I understand correctly). 

A minimal example is as follows:

    from multiprocessing import Process, Manager
    from timeit import default_timer as timer
    import time
    
    def fun(d, i):
        """"""Simply add some data to the shared list.""""""
        time.sleep(2)
        d.append((""workerbee"" + str(i), i))
    
    def main(n_processes):
        """"""Let's do some arbitrary thing to test overall logic.""""""
        print(""Starting!"")
        with Manager() as manager:
            data = manager.list()  # &lt;-- can be shared between processes.
            procs = []
    
            # Create n processes
            # if n is small =&gt; everything is fine
            # if n is large (&gt;100) =&gt; ForkAwareLocal object has no attr connection
            for i in range(n_processes):
                procs.append(Process(target=fun, args=(data, i)))
                procs[-1].start()
    
            for p in procs:
                p.join()
            print(f'Result in main: {data}')
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Choose number of processes
        # n_processes = 15
        n_processes = 150
    
        start = timer()
        main(n_processes)
        end = timer()
        print(f'elapsed time: {end - start}')
    

When using a small number of processes, the code works perfectly fine (\`n\_processes = 15\`) but when \`n\_processes\` becomes bigger than around 100 (differs per machine), the errors pop up.

It seems that the main process closes too soon and the \`p.join()\` function is not doing what I'm expecting (putting a timeout on subprocesses until they've finished). I've read a ton of similar SO posts, plus documentation, but can't seem to figure it out. Could someone help me with this?

A traceback of the error and processes are as follows, somewhere the MainProcess is suddenly just having enough of its life and deciding to shut down, bringing about errors and the nasty bits stated earlier.

However the issue is that if there is no data on the socket, this will immediately raise a [IncompleteReadError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.IncompleteReadError). 

So then one would do something like (untested):

It should say:

Now, it is normal to use the intel based version if not already updated to native silicon? I guess I'm just missing out on M1 performance?

From my understanding, the only way to download the native Python 3.9X versions is through homebrew / miniforge: [TLDR](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68228696/15230420). Is it worth updating, especially considering I'm starting to use TensorFlow, etc. for ML? Also, what happens to all my current envs and packages I have in (the current, intel based ) anaconda if I switch to Miniforge? Do they all translate, or what happens to the packages not optimised for arm64?

The Python version on anaconda is 38, PyCharm uses the same version and packages. as far as I can tell. After I install e.g. Pandas directly through windows command, I'm getting errors executing the code (that worked before) in Pycharm and Jupyter. The Errormessage I get, is that PyCharm/Jupyter can't find numpy. I have to deinstall numpy and pandas for PyCharm to find the old package again.

How can I fix this? Do I need to create a seperate Env for Python39? I updated anaconda and Py to the newest version via terminal, but I'm still getting this error. Is it because Python 39 is using newer package versions?

Good day, this is how my dataframe using panda looks:

    17/01/17, 19:30 - EH:     how is the place? 

What I'd like to do is to create a xlsx file that should look like this:

            total_msg   top_time 
    EH         4         19:00   
    AC         3         19:00 

Right know I've been able to get all the information I wanted (some example code below):

    sender = df['sender'].unique() msg_counts = df['sender'].value_counts() time_top3 = messages_df['time'].str.split(':', expand=True).stack().value_counts().head(1) 

but when I try to write on my excle file using openpyxl like this

    current_row = sheet.max_row  
    current_column = sheet.max_column   
    
    sheet.cell(row=current_row + 1, column=2).value = msg_counts 

I get this error: ValueError: Cannot convert EH4 AC 3 Name: sender, dtype: int64 to Excel

I guess what I need is find a way to work with one user at time (don't know if I'm making sense), but I don't know how to do that (also the name of the two user always change when different files are loaded).

also is it possible to have the two name of the sender as the name of the saved file (instead of ""data.xlsx"")?

This has not worked as I believe the script ended.

Currently working on a telegram bot and have it operational. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Task:** Log all text inputs from the chat into a text file. Having difficulty arriving at the correct parameter in the following:

`file_object.write()`  


I think part of my problem is I have many classes and I know if I insert my logger() function it will break the main() program likely because it's stuck in that logger() still. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance:

`file_object.write(""Hi!"")` works

but `file_object.write(input())` or `file_object.write(user_message)` do not work &amp; break the program

&amp;#x200B;

I am learning Python, and one thing I'm trying to understand is how exactly is the \_\_dict\_\_ key, which is a descriptor, in a class's \_\_dict\_\_ is implemented.

I understand that an instance of a class does not have a reference to its own \_\_dict\_\_ inside of its \_\_dict\_\_ due to it being a circular reference. As a result, a class has a descriptor for an instance's \_\_dict\_\_. However, I can't wrap my head around as to how this descriptor is implemented or where the actually \_\_dict\_\_ for an instance is stored(is it stored in the descriptor itself and if it is how does the descriptor retrieve it for every instance).

I'm working on a program that will read the save data for a video game (Chicory: A Colorful Tale), figure out what collectable items are missing, and tell the player what's left to get. Hoping it will help out 100% speedrunners, since there's a ton to pick up. I'm just working with sample data still, but I managed to output a to-do list of items that still need to be picked up, and after a lot of confusion got the PySimpleGui window to update itself too, but now I'm stuck at formatting it how I want.  
I'm using an sg.Window now, with just the one text element in the layout that displays f{theList}. If I use an sg.Window, and in the While True =&gt; Else: part near the end to update/close/etc. the window, I can tell it to call the UpdateList function, Window.Update, and as I run around in-game picking up items the dialog box updates on its own, no input from me! But it's all in one line, like:  


\[itemA, itemC, itemD\]  
Which is a little hard to keep read and make use of. Eventually, the list isn't going to be ""Item A,"" ""Item B,"" etc, it'll be quite wordy -- ""Item next to the Door,"" ""One screen left of this landmark,"" etc. So I wanted to make it, y'know, a list list. A verical list. I found [this advice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57239909/how-do-i-print-each-element-of-list-in-a-new-line-with-pysimplegui) to turn a list into a...whatever you wanna call what I want, but it works with sg.PopupScrolled.  The conundrum I'm in is:

  
A) If I use the join() solution on that link, my sg.Window only shows the first item -- I assume it doesn't handle multiple lines the way I have it outputting text.  
B) if I use sg.ScrolledPopup, it doesn't seem to interact with anything like Window.Read or Window.Update, which is how I'm auto-refreshing the window.  


I'm not sure the best way to handle this. I suppose, at least in my head, I could make a function that will generate a .Window layout by going through all items in theList and generating the \[sg.Text(WhatINeed)\], 's. I'm not sure that's the best approach, though. It just seems like there'd be a sleeker solution. 

When trying to figure out how to update a window or read a file in ""real-time,"" most of the solutions revolved around ""tail""-like options. Due to how the save file is structured, that's not an option here -- but I don't need it to update ""real time"" instantaneously -- the game auto-saves on a bit of a delay sometimes, anyway. I \*do\* need the screen to update on its own, though -- if I have to click out of the game window to update the list, then it's not really helping me as a speedrunner. That's why using sg.Window and Window.Update does what I want, provided I can make it, well, a bit prettier.",learnpython,sg.Window vs sg.PopupScrolled with Auto-Refresh,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/ocrn0e/sgwindow_vs_sgpopupscrolled_with_autorefresh/

I am running a Django/Django rest back-end to handle authentication of users. Up until this point all of my projects were purely Django based and so authentication was happening directly on the back-end. This time, I have a JavaScript React front-end which has a login page component.

What I would like to do is to connect the React front-end with the Django back-end such that when users login on the front, their credentials get passed to Django for authentication and login.

If there would be no React front-end, I would simply have a login view which accepts a request object and then utilizes the django.contrib.auth authenticate method.

     user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
        if user is not None:
            login(request, user)
            # Redirect to a success page.

            # Return an 'invalid login' error message.

Hi,

So I am currently working on a project which has the main objective of extracting frames from a video at a certain rate and passing that into a deep learning algorithm for image processing. So I have the basic program code of opencv which takes a video as input and splits into frames,but I am having trouble integrating that with the algorithm.

So I understand videoObject.ExtractFrame() returns the image object, now I am confused as to how to substitute that with cv.Imread() function call. There is a imread call in the algorithm which is basically for images, and thus I am having some trouble passing this image object that I obtain via splitting into that.

Does anyone have any idea about this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am new to python and have a problem. I am writing a python script where I am running a command on the system(with subprocess.run()). I store the system output in a variable and work with it afterwards.

So the problem is the following. When I call the function that is making the system call a single time I always get the correct output. If I make a loop over the function call(with a 5 second delay) only the first output is correct and the rest is wrong. Each iteration is giving me the same output eventhough it is actually different.

I thought python might be caching the result and reusing it but I did not really have success in fixing it. I googled a lot but still have not found anything that helps.

53,Flatliner521,1622652377,nqq8tr,2,1,"Hi everyone,

So my main task is to convert  csv files to  csv files with different column headers and a different time format.  The original csv's contain stock price data with the following columns: ""time"", ""open"", ""high"",""low"", ""close"".

I want this data to be readable by a different app which reads csv's of the following format:  
""date"",  ""open"", ""high"", ""low"", ""close"", ""volume"". In addition, I want the new csv's to have a year's worth of artificial data before the actual data start. e.g. if the data starts on 1 / 1 / 2018, the new csv will begin in 1 /1 / 2017 and every day the colums will have the same constant values which are these that their original counterparts had on the first day of the actual data i.e. on 1 /1 /2018 for this example.

&amp;#x200B;

I started by creating an empty dataframe with the column headers I want and its length equal to 1 year plus whatever length the original csv has:

&amp;#x200B;

import pandas as pd

from datetime import datetime, timedelta

&amp;#x200B;

data = pd.read\_csv(r""original.csv"")

new = pd.DataFrame(index = range(0, 365 + len(crypto)), columns = \['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume'\])

I then filled up the new dataframe with the artificial data:  


for i in range(0, 364):

new.loc\[i, 'Open'\] = data\['open'\]\[0\]

new.loc\[i, 'High'\] = data\['high'\]\[0\]

new.loc\[i, 'Low'\] = data\['low'\]\[0\]

new.loc\[i, 'Close'\] = data\['close'\]\[0\]

new.loc\[i, 'Volume'\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck at trying to fill up the date columns. The original csv has the date in UNIX time format.

The idea is to take the starting date of the original csv, convert it to mm/dd/yyyy format and then fill up the Date column from the bottom up. 

I tried to keep the starting date to a variable like this:  
start\_Date =  pd.to\_datetime(data\['time'\]\[0\], unit = 's')

The problem is that print(start\_Date) returns this:  
 2020-08-12 00:00:00 

&amp;#x200B;

The new csv will be unreadable if I do not adhere to the mm/dd/yyyy format so I have to both hide the ""00:00:00"" part and change the yyyy-mm-dd format.

I tried hiding the time by chaning unit to 'd"" but I get this error:  
 **OutOfBoundsDatetime**: cannot convert input with unit 'd' 

I also had no lack by explicitly settting the format:

start\_Date =  pd.to\_datetime(data\['time'\]\[0\], format = '%mm/%dd/%yyyy')  
 **ValueError**: time data '1597190400' does not match format '%mm/%dd/%yyyy' (match) 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

I have 2 questions about np.arrays:

Number one:

(also shown in image - [https://imgur.com/a/2hIkJMJ](https://imgur.com/a/2hIkJMJ))

Lets say I have I have 2 arrays:

\[\[ x1 y1

x2 y2

x3 y3\]\]

then I have array (for this example lets say just one point):

\[\[x4\]\]

how can calculate corresponding y4 value as shown on the image when i know only x4 value? Between points there is always straight line with known x's and y's.

I was considering using somehow range functions or finding when x4 is over whatever x in another array, then for that row calculating values but I'm struggling to complete the code or possibly I'm overthinking this.

Other question is rather simple:

when printing as follows:

np.set\_printoptions(precision=2, floatmode=""fixed"")

print(array)

If a value in array is integer or have anything after point, it just prints as 5 (or 5,5) and not 5,50. How can I fix it so it always shows proper precision/rounding? Even with fixed floatmode the print value is 5,50 but the real value as used in other commands stays 5,5 and proper floatpoint is not transfered.",learnpython,Two question about values in np.array,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/nqqmpz/two_question_about_values_in_nparray/

Currently I have to create a new line of code for each bird time in the area to run some stats on. My question is:

Can I write some code, to read the entries in a column then have each unique bird type, go into a new column.

Below are images of my code, as well as the bird spreadsheet showing some bird types in my columns as well as the current final result to show what my goal is.

Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s  
 in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl'  
, then your program should print:

    Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd'  
, then your program should print

i heard about pikepdf : 

It provides a Pythonic wrapper around the C++ PDF content transformation library, QPDF. Python + QPDF ... Extract content from a PDF such as text or images.

**PDFDocEncoding**

The PDF specification defines PDFDocEncoding, a character encoding used only in PDFs. This encoding matches ASCII for code points 32 through 126 (0x20 to 0x7e). At all other code points, it is not ASCII and cannot be treated as equivalent. If you look at a PDF in a binary file viewer (hex editor), a string surrounded by parentheses such as (Hello World) is usually using PDFDocEncoding.

When pikepdf is imported, it automatically registers ""pdfdoc"" as a codec with the standard library, so that it may be used in string and byte conversions. cf. [https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/encoding.html](https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/encoding.html)

&gt;Write a **recursive** function **getPyDir**() that takes a string representing a name of a directory as a parameter and returns the full name of the first directory that contains a Python file in it. A Python file is a file that ends in .py (in any possible capitalization, e.g., .py, .PY, .pY, or .Py). If the directory structure does not contain any directories with Python files in them, the function returns None (the value in Python not a string). Please note that your function must be recursive and that it must work as described on any directory structure, not just the ones provided as examples. You cannot make any assumptions about the locations of the files in the directory structure, the types of files in the directory structure, or the depth of the directory structure. You may not change the number of parameters of the function, provide default values to the parameters, define any helper functions, or use any global variables. The function must return and not print the first directory containing a Python file. It is expected that a correct recursive solution to the problem will contain at least one loop, although the majority of the work will be done via recursion. Your code must work on any operating system.

        for item in os.listdir(path):
            itemPath = os.path.join(path, item)
            if os.path.isdir(itemPath):
                getPyDir(itemPath)
            else:
                if os.path.isfile(itemPath):
                    if itemPath.endswith('.py'):
                        print (itemPath)

if image is None:

pyautogui.click(x=1165, y=390, clicks=1, interval=1, button='left')

pyautogui.click(x=1122, y=105, clicks=1, interval=1, button='left')
(the coordinate divider is because of a small workaround as my MacBook Pro has higher pixel density and therefore causes problems with the screenshot tool of pyautogui.)

But whenever I try to locate and click the image.png its not detecting anything even when the image is right in the screen.. I have searched a lot on the forums but couldn't find a solution. Was hoping someone could help me out as this has been really frustrating me! How can I let my script recognise the images when the script is running? thanks in advance

11,linuxphoney,1620010351,n3m9pc,6,1,"So I'm working on a text based rpg to help me learn more python, and I dob't want to overlook testing,  so  right now I sort of have the following format: 

A classes class that contains things like Story, Npc, Character, etc. 

An init.py that just populates those based on user choices. 

main.py that runs the game (basically creating a Story and calling init).  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my user input bits are, by definition, narrative. So I make heavy use of print() and input(), sometimes for actual input, but more often for a pause in the text, so the user can read a bit at a time and hit enter to continue.  For example: 

    input(""Welcome to this game.  Press enter to continue."")
    input(""Soon you will decide what sort of story this is."")
    print(""Please select the sort of story you want to tell."")
    input(""1: fantasy, 2: sci-fi, 3: weird copypasta"")

That is in a function called set\_story, which takes in a story object, prints that out, notes the choice, and returns the updated story (with the type set, for example)

So, I know how to mock the input for a single element in the unit test, but can I also just do something like:

More of a network guy than a developer, but have been dabling in python for a little over a year.  It started getting out of hand with the revisions and naming conventions and am starting to try using github.  I am finding it more difficult than learning to code in python!  Any pointers would be much obliged!

My problem:

I am using Pycharm as an IDE, it seems like a good fit for me, and not as flashy as vsc.  I wrote several cool scripts to program new switches via the console(serial) port that I am really proud of and have invested many many many many hours massaging into a useable project.  I am still tweaking and adding minor features daily.  Easy peasy... I make the changes on my company laptop, where I created these scripts, commit and push to github...BOOM.  Works like a charm.  So far so good.

My schedule is strange, where I work out of town for a couple weeks, then have a couple weeks off.  Rinse and repeat.  So while I was at home, I had a brilliant idea!!!  What if I did ""x,y,z"" to make it for switch model A and B!!!  Brilliant, I know.  This github thingie is really gonna pay off!  So I whip out my personal laptop, install Pycharm and clone my repository.  Again, easy peasy.

Except, my cloned copy is not living in a virtual environment, but right out in global.  Is there a way to clone the actual venv as well?

On top off that, work pc is using 3.8 and personal pc is running 3.9.4...does this matter?  Something tells me it does, and the last commit included a .idea/misc.xml that changed  """"project-jdk-name=""Python 3.8"""" to """"project-jdk-name=""Python 3.9"""".  Should I be worried about screwing up my master???

At the end of the day, I would like my 2 pc's to have an identical environment, identical file structure... isn't that the point?  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Jetbrains has a ton of online help, but it seems to be focused on macs, because I don't have half the buttons they are talking about!

I have created a dictionary of all 50 states with their keys being their number of homicides. 

below is my code for input validation of the states 

def get\_user\_input():

user\_state2 = input('Invalid, please enter another state: ')  
 return user\_state and user\_state2

x = \[user\_state, user\_state2\]  
y = homicide\_statistics\[user\_state\], homicide\_statistics\[user\_state2\]

I've been a huge fan of FOSS and that's mainly because of it community. The very idea of people going extra step to create something for others to use, free of charge is extraordinary.

I've been a huge consumer of FOSS over the years, and I've decided to contribute back to the community, even if by a little.  Here is the link to the library.

 [prep-ml · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/prep-ml/) 

The idea of the library is to further simplify Machine learning pre-processing so that users with little python knowledge can start building models.

And so, I had this idea and created an open-source library which I honestly believe could be useful to the community. With that idea, I went ahead and made the first cut and published it. 

With that said, I am aware that, something I feel useful would not necessarily prove useful to others, which is why I am here, taking feedback from the community.

2 months ago I started an online course in Python Basics. 

I really enjoy Python and I would love to learn it to the fullest!

In the basics course we learned:

* simple operations (+, -, \*, /, %, //)
* conditional statements (if-elif-else)
* nested conditional statements
* for/while loops
* nested loops

The next course I started is called Python Fundamentals and so far I learned:

* lists basics
* functions (but I haven't practiced them a lot)
* lists advanced

The thing is that while in class we are solving very easy tasks while the tasks we have to do alone are very complicated (at least in my opinion). 

I will give you an example:

When we started learning Lists basics we solved [these tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v41fK-JmlAvOu-Ev-UnaYDiDVfMbTH6NJAKrBlzikVo/edit?usp=sharing).

And the tasks we had to solve alone are [these](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rGcwZfmcYz0ywjfHbGHFCzcXGFnm4kECMuPOk5Rw-w/edit?usp=sharing).

May I ask for a few pointers?

If you have a SQL query, how do you access the individual fields to check types, correct data issues etc in code?

e.g.

Using pyodbc

    connection = pyodbc.connect(connectionstring)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    list_sql = """"""
                SELECT  EMPLOYEE_CODE,
                        EMPLOYEE_NAME,
                        INACTIVE,
                        OFFC,
                        DEPT
                FROM    STAFF_TABLE
                """"""
    
    cursor.execute(list_sql)
    
    for record in cursor:
        print(record)

So this allows me to print out each row. 

What I want to be able to do  is to access each field and validate the data or correct any data type issue.  The output looks like each row is a tuple.

Questions:

1. Is this the correct way to do this?
2. Should I be mapping the SQL to a data class that mirrors the query structure? If so how would I do this?

I have been working on a group project recently. My group has an idea of simulating astronomical activities—for example, a black hole or supernova explosion. We all have experiences in Python programming, mainly data analysis. We are looking for some visualization libraries in Python or any programming languages that could display our simulation.

The simulation will be in 2D, and it's not to be a complicated simulation. To give a clear picture of how it will look like, we plan to draw a black hole and has an object somewhere near the black hole. We then move the object towards the black hole, and we want to animate the change in gravitational field lines around it.

We found a visualization library called three.js, but we are only familiar with Python. 

Does anyone have experience with this? We prefer something easy to learn.

I'm currently planning a software project where I'm not a 100% sure about the way I should go and I thought that some of you might have some ideas and/or input that could help me. If this is not the right place to post this could you give me a pointer to the right one?

I'm planning a system that should run on a Coral Dev Board (basically a Raspberry Pi + TPU) where two tasks should be done in parallel. Both tasks, which do not rely on each other, use an image input from a camera that is connected to the board.  The reason why I want them to run in parallel is that the first task is a lot faster than the second one and thus I want to take advantage of this to process more frames at the same time. Both tasks should only use the newest frame that is avaliable at the time they start. 

My question now is how is should design the architecture behind this project. The project relies mainly on Python but I would like to exchange some parts of the project C++ modules later on. My idea so far was to wrap the image acquisition, task 1 and task 2 in a process each and then let them communicate through a queue where the image acqusition adds images and both tasks get them. 

My problem is that I don't have a lot of experience with multi-process programming in general and specifically in Python/C++. My questions are:

\* Should I rely on threads or processes in this scenario?

\* Does it make sense to run a multi-processing system like this on a very constrained CPU like the one the Coral Dev board has?

\* Is there an easy way for processes in C++ and Python to communicate properly?

\* Are queues the right way of communication between processes here?

\* Are there any problems and pitfalls that I should look out for?

So my team is working on Deep learning-based models and few classical ML-based models (mainly built using sklearn). I'm being told that if I were to expose the ML algos using microservices on a production-grade scale then I don't have many options other than Java.

According to my tech manager, java is the only platform that can reliably manage a load of 5k requests at once and that's why I have to port all deep learning-based code from python to DJL because DJL is supposed to be fast and memory-efficient. The sklearn based machine learning models are also being ported into onnx runtime and are being executed in java.

My question is, 1) looking at a purely performance point of view Is it an absolute necessity to port inference code into Java env? Can't python apis like django and FastApi provide the same reliable microservice experience as java?

2) sklearn and PyTorch already execute their code in a highly optimized c/c++ subroutine under their python wrapper(on GPUs), then what performance gain could we achieve by running this in a java environment?

I think since he (or any other developer in engg team) does not have much experience with python-based microservices, he wants to port every model inference code in java.

Although, I didn't have any experience with SQL at all and only 4 days to get a basic understanding of it for the exam. The fact that I had some experience with Python made the the task a lot less intimidating. 

SQL and Python are hardly similar at all but having experience in another language and being able to think somewhat programmatically really helped in getting me a basic understanding of SQL 

When I took the test I got most of the SQL questions and the industry questions correct but according to my interviewers they were the most impressed with how I answered the pseudocode question

The Pseudocode they gave me was essentially Python Code!! it only had some missing bits but it was essentially a simple while loop with the same exact indentation that Python code is known for so it was an easy answer for me.

Later on, subsequent interviews they asked me about how I knew how to answer the question and I mentioned that I practiced Python on the side and they tested me on my knowledge of the language and I got most of their questions right (Keep in mind that I haven't programmed in Python for months but the knowledge stuck!)

Really simple and silly questions here however I’m having a huge amount of trouble understanding how to conduct statistics in python - mainly with understanding the P value.

Both messages allude to the same perceived root cause: lack of valid API key. However, this is just not the case. According to the website I used ( open weather ), a few things could cause the given error ( 401 ): invalid API key, not enough time spent after generating your first key, and trying to access premium services. I did get a valid API key, and even generated another one just to test it out ( with no different result ), I waited hours after my first attempt, so the possibility of my key not yet having finished the process of authorization is minimal, and I've checked multiple time which API services I requested, and they were the free ones ( current weather ) ONLY.

The upload button doesn't use an id just class. But given that it's the first button with that class I can probably get away with clicking it.

Then it opens a box that says upload from your device which again is a button but it's the only one so simple.

Next it opens the file explorer and after this point I'm lost as to how to direct it to my books folder and upload files.

I'm a mechanical engineer and learned coding through Matlab, which to me, makes *perfect* sense. Not only is the language intuitive and easy to learn (with amazing help, tutorial, videos, etc), but it's all seemingly contained within 1 program (minus any desired add-ons). I open Matlab from desktop, set my working directory and everything is ready. 

Because of my background in Matlab, I naturally gravitated towards Spyder as my Python IDE as the similarities are obvious. 

I downloaded Spyder 3 through Anaconda2 a couple years back and have scripts written in Python 2 that I would like to keep and have access to run still. Moving forward, however, I'd like to use Spyder 4 (includes autocomplete) and Python 3. I'm very confused with several things and just looking for some helpful explanation that I haven't been able to find on Google. 

1.) Where should I download and keep everything and separate python versions? Can everything be kept in one parent folder? After downloading Anaconda, I thought everything was here (C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Anaconda2), but have come across several other folders (most of them empty) in various other places. I'm OCD when it comes to computer storage/organization so would like it as clean as possible. 

2.) In the above ""Anaconda2"" folder is the python.exe for version 2.7. Where should I keep all the python download files for 3.7 so that I can use either in Anaconda/Spyder?

3.) How to properly download packages? Apparently Anaconda comes with PIP, but I've been told to not use PIP to install packages or update anything as it can cause issues with Anaconda, and use the Anaconda Prompt instead? Well, my Anaconda Prompt seemingly never works. I've tried to update Anaconda and Spyder this way and always get ""an HTTP error occured when trying to retrieve this url"". So... I downloaded Spyder 4 on its own from their website, but now is not tied to Anaconda at all so I can't launch it from Anaconda nor does it include any of the packages. 

4.) Like I said, Anaconda would not update from the prompt, so I'm scared to update it manually by downloading the most recent version online (wouldn't this redownload existing packages and everything and be a huge mess?). Do I need to worry about updating Anaconda to work with Spyder 4 and Python 3? If so, what's the best way to do this now?

I spent the next 12 months learning both webdev skills (html, css frameworks and now properly learning JavaScript) and slowly falling in love with Python. I subscribed to every Python subreddit, forum, learning resource and YouTube channel I could find. In particular I went through the entirety of Learn Python the Hard Way, which gave me a solid foundation and also went through the Codecademy track and FreeCodeCamp.

Unfortunately, this was the point that I fell into tutorial hell. I became completely reliant on tutorials. I wasn't able to think up projects and implement them by myself. All I could do was follow a tutorial from beginning to end (and not even always to the end), and honestly not understand half the code that I was typing. I did make a conscious effort not to copy and paste code, but without truly understanding what the code I was typing did, it didn't really make much difference. This began a yearly cycle of ""getting into"" Python, following tutorials until I burned out, not learning much and then just stopping. This rinse and repeat process happened over and over until I hit my late twenties.

I had spent literally years wanting to be a professional developer, but had never felt confident enough in my skills to go for it. I occasionally sent out a job application for junior positions hoping they'd take me on in the form of an apprenticeship, but looking back I can see just how laughable my applications were. I had _nothing_ to show in the form of a portfolio. Nothing that wasn't just a rehashed tutorial project with a few variable names changed and some different choices of colours. During this period, I did manage to escape the dreaded world of retail. I landed a customer service position in Supply Chain for a large company, and from this managed to form a real career working through the various departments that existed there. This was great for my self-confidence and my wallet, but it absolutely did not excite me. 

I had started doing things like Project Euler, Advent of Code and other similar coding challenges, and I found that I loved them. They gave me a challenge without many clues of how to solve it, and I had to just go at it with Python to try and get a solution. Obviously, I would get stuck and then hit the search engines, but this was one of the greatest lessons I had every learned - it is okay to search for the gaps in your knowledge. These challenges pushed me to learn all kinds of programming concepts I'd never really come across before, and they did it in the form of a game. I learned about recursion, regex, proper uses of functions, classes and dictionaries (and creative ways to iterate through them) and so much more. Best of all, once I'd solved these problems I'd head over to their communities and look at other peoples solutions. This was a game-changer. Now I could see how my brute-forced (but successful) attempts were clumsy, and how I could have written them more elegantly and efficiently. I'd go through this very positive feedback loop of solving these problems, searching when I needed help and then comparing with others and repeating, and it felt great. Eventually, I realised that I'd built up enough skills doing this that I could actually automate a few of the more boring tasks at work. I read through the highly recommended 'Automate the Boring Stuff' by Al Sweigart and off I went.

In about 12 months I had automated nearly every report I had involvement with, automated all date collection from our various suppliers and customers, and even managed to use PyAutoGUI to automate some of the mind numbing and repetitive tasks I had to do in SAP (where I was only allowed access to the GUI, no scripting...). I created a few Flask apps that allowed me to do some of this and share a bit of it with some close co-workers too, but mostly I kept this to myself. Early on in the process of doing Project Euler I had created a GitHub to host my solutions, so I regularly added and updated my scripts on there to.

At this point, I had completely fallen in love with programming. I wanted more. I needed more. I knew at this point, that I would only become more miserable in my current career and decided at this point that I would aim to gain employment in a junior software position within 12 months. And then COVID came... This was a blessing and a curse. The job market became a mixture of stagnant and more competitive due to all of the lay-offs. But I had way more time on my hands thanks to permanent remote working. During this time I threw together a few simple web dev projects so I had something of a portfolio, but more importantly I tidied up all of the scripts I'd been using at work and threw on some READMEs explaining what they do and why I'd created them. I sent out regular job applications during this time, for all kinds of positions. Then in January, it happened. 

I applied to a small company that specialises in open source software and they got back to me asking if I'd like to interview. I spoke with the managing director and explained to him why I'm interested in the role, why I thought I'd be a good fit and then went through some typical interview questions. We got on well, and it turned out that the software they create is similar to the software that I was using and automating every day (SAP). I then went on to a second interview, this time with HR and their lead developer, where I was asked some question on how I would solve several problems in general terms (I didn't have to actually code anything). This went well and I was offered a junior position the following week.

I'm now just over 6 weeks in role, and I feel absolutely in over my head. Every day I hit wall after wall of problems I have no idea how to solve, and feel like I'm constantly fighting our framework of choice. But I love it. I'm finally doing it every day, and someone is actually paying me to do so. I can hardly believe it. I have a long way to go, but the team I'm in is super supportive and I can't wait to get the training wheels of and really get stuck in to something.

All in all, going from an interest in python to working as junior python developer took me a little over seven years. Could this have been done quicker? No doubt. If I had the right focus from the beginning, this probably could have been a year or two. But if my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bicycle. This is the pace it took me, and ultimately I'm really happy.

I know many of you learning have read similar stories before, and I know mine may not be that different from others, but hopefully a few of you might get some helpful takeaways from my story. If I was to summarise the keys steps that landed me employment, it would be these (this is the TLDR):

* Learn the basics of the language, and learn them well. Learn about data types, for loops, while loops, how to iterate through lists, take inputs. Learn about booleans and boolean logic. Learn about functions and classes (and perhaps a bit about object oriented programming). I spent far far FAR too long on this step...

* Learn how to make something. This can be anything. For me this was simple calculators and games to begin with, and moved on to simple programs that could rename files in my media folders.

* Take part in challenges that make use of programming. I adore Advent of Code and the community surrounding it, but there is also Project Euler, Code Wars and I'm sure plenty of others. Take your time with these. Don't cheat (by searching for other solutions before completing your own), but do feel free to use search engines, Reddit and Stack Overflow for ways to achieve sub tasks within your solution. When your done definitely go and compare against other people's solutions, and make note of why someone else's might be better.

* Make use of tutorials and and websites such as Codecademy, but don't *rely* on them. For anything you make during a tutorial, make something similar but different making use of your new skills and using stack overflow to fill gaps in your knowledge for features that weren't covered in the tutorial and that you don't already know.

* Create a GitHub and upload everything you make. Tidy things up and and README files to them.

* Soft skills / related skills: These are all the things you can transfer from other employment such as leadership, teamwork, effective communication etc, but also related tech skills. On my journey I learned how to use Linux, became comfortable with the command line and set up my own VPS on Digital Ocean (and one on Linode). This is NOT as difficult as it might sound if you've never done it before, but it does take some learning.

* Find ways to implement what you learn in to your current job if possible. Automate some processes. Scrape useful data. 

But really, all of the above can be shortened to: Study the language, build things, showcase what you've built.

Hello,

For my Python class, we are writing a program that accepts two string inputs, compares them, and outputs a modified version of the original string.

I need to: make it lowercase, split by whitespace into words, remove commas and periods, and join the words with dashes. Unfortunately, I am having trouble stripping the white space and joining the words. Whenever I try the join() feature, it either doesn't work or it joins them by letter, not by word.

I have tried Googling, and I cannot find anything explaining why it simply is not working in my code.

I've tried GeeksforGeeks, stackoverflow, realpython... My code looks like theirs, it's just not working.

Code below. TIA!

How would you implement creating a graph to plot these coordinates in coordinates\_0?

I would like to use matplotlib to do this but I would like to plot these points below:

Allen has a row of rocks, represented by an array of nonzero integers. Each rock moves to the right if its integer is positive, and left otherwise. The power of each rock is its integer squared. Assuming that each rock moves at the same speed, some rocks will meet. If two rocks meet, the one with less  power disappears. If both rocks have the same power, both rocks disappear. Return the array after all such meetings have occurred. Two rocks moving in the same direction do not meet.

I'm in high school right now and wanted to learn python specifically and eventually get to a point where I can freelance. The only experience I've had is taking apcs last year which gave me a basic Java skill set. I have a few questions. 

1. I'm pretty sure I can't just learn python in depth, I will have to learn multiple languages to be able to do projects. What languages do you recommend me learning?

2. What platforms do you recommend to get started? I've tried upwork before for business plan freelancing and it's super competitive.

3. Any recommendations on what I should try and ""specialize"" in?

4. I'm a pretty quick learner with most things, how long would you expect it to take for me to be able to get to a level where I can freelance (hours)?

5. The reason I primarily want to learn python is because algo trading intrigues me. Is there a good market for algo model development?  

6. What should I expect my hourly rate to be when I start out?

I'm running a flask webserver with a raspberry pi 3B+. The html website has some text, and two buttons. One button to run a external python script (not the flask python script) and one button to stop the python script.

So far, pressing the ""start"" button makes my external python script run just how I want it to. That works perfectly and I have no complaints about that

I want my ""stop"" button to stop the external python script that I started running with the ""start"" button. The script has a never ending while loop in it.

I've tried everything I can think of:

* creating a 'running' boolean variable, so that the while loop only runs when that variable equals true, and then using the stop button to change that variable.
* Having a ""exit()"" function inside of my external script that I call when my ""stop"" button is pressed.

None of that works. It just causes my webserver to crash and my external script keeps running (lol)

I get ""TypeError: The view function did not return a valid response.""

In the famous petal data the attributes were: sepal-length, sepal-width, petal-length, petal-width. But, the data set I am working with right now is very different, that is, I am crime mapping and working with totally different attributes. 

I have a Data Frame with columns: **Description, Year Month Day, Hour, Minute, Seconds, Coordinates, Latitude, and Longitude.** 

I am wondering what exactly would be the attributes here? The petal data is much easier to understand in terms of the attributes, but I am stuck on this one other than location (Latitude and Longitude) positions as attributes? Although this makes little sense to me because the attributes of location do not help describe the type of crime that was committed. 

I would assume that the Descriptions of the types of crimes will be classified into a certain number of classes generally the square root of the number of data points. So, in my Data Frame I have exactly 1242 data points, and so the square root of 1242 is 35.24202, that is, k=35? Am i understanding this correctly in determining the value k? Now, how would one determine the number of classes? I was initially thinking about setting up the classes into 4 distinct categories: 1. Hyper-Violent Crime: Murder,  Rape, Kidnapping, Assault of the highest degree (and so on), Hyper-Domestic Violence 2. Lesser-Violent Crime: Assault of a Lower Degree, Lesser Domestic Violence, Car Jacking, (and so on), 3. Hyper Non-Violent Crime (yet, crime that could result in bodily injury): DUI, Robbery, and so on, 4. Lesser Non-Violent Crime: Public Intoxication, Petty Theft, Vandalism and so on. So, these would be the classes if I am understanding everything correctly. Does this make sense? Apart from the fact that the classes can be somewhat subjective, does the abstract sense of creating the classes for the crime descriptions make sense in terms of this algorithm?

13,LukeNVIII,1614773394,lwseyg,12,2,"Hi, hopefully this is a rather short question. I'll try and phrase it concretely.

Short version: What makes a file a module and how can I get this to show the docstrings + fill in variables when calling the functions in the imported module? I have two very similar files containing multiple functions where one can be imported and still shows the docstrings + fills in variables and the other don't. 

Some background:

We are three people building a model together for a research project using HyperSpy with the spyder environment in anaconda. We have made many classes and functions and have started to combine these in files (modules if I understand correctly). What confuses me is that we have two different files containing functions where one also contains a class. When using a function from the file with only functions I see the docstring and it shows what variables is needed (and it calls it a function) but this does not show when using functions from the other file, with a class in it, (and it calls this a module). After looking around on the internet it seems both files should be considered modules, at least based on this: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), but I don't find anything about getting the docstrings out of a module. 

A difference between the files is that the one that only contains functions only imports librarys that we haven't made our self, like HyperSpy.api, nympy and matplotlib.pyplot. The other one also imports some of our own files with classes and functions. 

I've also tried to remove the class from the file that is considered a module but it doesn't work.",learnpython,How to get functions to show docstring + fill in variables when imported via a module?

48,nickthorpie,1614786505,lwwyg7,0,1,"Hey guys, this is more of a physics question, but I'm not seeing a lot of documentation online for momentum update!

I have a school project that involves simulating a motorized car driving up a ramp. I'm approximating the car as a rolling wheel, and I'm going to do the problem as a momentum update simulation.

I was wondering if I need to update my angular momentum every time as well, if so how do I do it.

At the moment my process is

1. Resolve the slope of the floor at that point
2. Calculate motor torque at the wheel (From my motor profile, T(ω)
3. compute x and y forces (τ/r is always tangential to ground, normal is perpendicular, gravity down. Resolve into components)
4. momentum(p) += F\*dt
5. position(X) += p/m\*dt
6. ω = (|ΔX|/r)/dt
7. repeat

My biggest worry is in step 2. My force and torque equations boil down to

1. ΣF = Ff + FN + Fg
2. ΣΤ = Iα = τ - Ff \* r.

where I assume that Iα is negligible because, a) I don't know if I can obtain an accurate moment of inertia, b) the significance of this term is not as significant when you consider that the mass of the wheel is very small compared to the rest of the car, and c) I don't know where I'd obtain an angular acceleration for this step.

My second biggest worry is in step 3. I make an assumption that angular momentum doesn't have a significant impact on the translation of the wheel, because I don't understand how to account for it",learnpython,2D Momentum update with a rolling wheel?,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lwwyg7/2d_momentum_update_with_a_rolling_wheel/

50,synthphreak,1614786849,lwx3b4,18,0,"**Problem statement:** I have a df with lots of data per row. I want to split each row into multiple rows so that the resulting rows each contain only one ""piece"" of data, where ""piece"" means values from one or more columns that are related in some way (identifiable by shared column name prefix).

It's probably clearer to just look at an example. **Take the following dummy dataframe as the starting point:**
 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; df
        a   b            c:x            c:y               d
    0  a0  b0           c:x0           c:y0              d0
    1  a1  b1  c:x1.1|c:x1.2  c:y1.1|c:y1.2              d1
    2  a2  b2           c:x2           c:y2             NaN
    3  a3  b3            NaN            NaN  d3.1|d3.2|d3.3
    4  a4  b4            NaN            NaN              d4
    5  a5  b5            NaN            NaN             NaN

Columns `['a', 'b']` contain metadata, while columns `['c:x', 'c:y', 'd']` contain data. Moreover, because columns `['c:x', 'c:y']` share the prefix `'c:'`, they are related and should be treated as a group; how many such groups there may be can't be known in advance, however they will always be identifiable/groupable by starting with `'{some_prefix}:'`. Lastly, notice that on a couple rows, individual data columns may contain multiple distinct values, delimited by `'|'` (e.g., `df.loc[3, 'd']`).

What I want is to convert my df from the ""dense"" structure above where each row has a lot going on, to a simpler ""sparse"" structure where each row contains only the data pertaining to a single group of data columns, with the remaining data columns being `NaN`. Moreover, whenever individual rows get split into multiple rows, the values in the metadata columns `['a', 'b']` should remain constant across all new rows.

Thus, **the resulting dataframe would look like the following (note I retained the original index values to make it clearer which rows had been split and how many times each):**

    &gt;&gt;&gt; df
        a   b     c:x     c:y     d
    0  a0  b0    c:x0    c:y0   NaN    
    0  a0  b0     NaN     NaN    d0
    1  a1  b1  c:x1.1  c:y1.1   NaN
    1  a1  b1  c:x1.2  c:y1.2   NaN
    1  a1  b1     NaN     NaN    d1
    2  a2  b2    c:x2    c:y2   NaN
    3  a3  b3     NaN     NaN  d3.1
    3  a3  b3     NaN     NaN  d3.2
    3  a3  b3     NaN     NaN  d3.3
    4  a4  b4     NaN     NaN    d4
    5  a5  b5     NaN     NaN   NaN

After transforming in this way, each row should only contain non-`NaN` values for a single group of data columns (ignoring the metadata columns).

Finally, note that when necessary to split values on `'|'` across a group of related columns (e.g., `{'c:x' : 'c:x1.1|c:x1.2', 'c:y' : 'c:y1.1|c:y1.2'}`), the splits across all columns should be grouped in order. In other words, if `'i1|j1'` in one column and `i2|j2` in another, `['i1', 'i2']` should go together as should `['j1', 'j2']` because their components are first and second, respectively, after splitting on `'|'`.

This is quite complicated, I know, and so way beyond my wrangling abilities. My hope is that pandas is able to achieve it all in just a few (possibly complex) lines, but who knows. Let me know if any points are unclear. Thanks in advance!

**Edit:** The following code seems to split values on `'|'` and explode each split onto a new row, which is one component of what I'm trying to do:
 
    df.set_index(['a', 'b']).apply(lambda s: s.str.split('|').explode()).reset_index())
 
However the `.explode()` sometimes leads to the following error which I don't see much info about on Google:
 
    ValueError: cannot handle a non-unique multi-index!

For the remainder of what I need, I'm totally stumped.

63,Successful-Standard,1614793205,lwzmri,10,0,"So I have some code to prepare data for time series plotting. I'm just having an issue with the week numbers I'm getting. Due to the way I've built the week numbers, the values for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of January are all 52 higher than they should be. This is because they fall in the same week as the last 4 days of December and my week number is calculated from this (see code below). I could just hard code these days to be week 53 instead of 105, but I want to future proof it. I'm just not so good with Pandas and am confused how I can do this. Sample data:

&amp;#x200B;

|week\_number|year|new\_week\_number|
|:-|:-|:-|
|53|2021|105|
|53|2020|53|
|53|2020|53|
|52|2020|53|

I had to calculate the new\_week\_number because for every new year the week\_number was resetting to 1 which was no good. What I want to do is subset the maximum week\_number for a year, then for every row with that week\_number (i.e. 53), find the minimum value in the new\_week\_number column, and apply that value for every row that had 53 in the week\_number. That was really confusing to type so I hope I've explained that as clearly as I can, please tell me if this makes no sense, but I think it does XD Here's the code I'm currently working with, I want to solve this problem before the last 5 lines of code, I think that's the best place to put it:

    import pandas as pd
    from datetime import datetime, date
    
    # Read data
    sentimentTweets = pd.read_csv(""filepath"", parse_dates=False)
    pd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None

    # Make week number correct for different years

66,Justin98O,1614797117,lx16l8,4,2,"I have a long excel file of students. It includes their names and their test score. Each student can attempt the test 3 times. I have a `Student` class and `ClassOfStudents` class:

    class Student:
        def __init__(self, last_name, first_name ):
            self.first_name = first_name
            self.last_name = last_name
            self.score_first_attempt = 0
            self.score_second_attempt = 0
            self.score_third_attempt = 0
    
    class ClassOfStudents:
        """"""Represents one class""""""
        def __init__(self, cohort, assignment_name):

            self.students = []
        def add_student(self, student_obj):
            self.students.append(student_obj)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The excel data is stored in this format: `first name, last name, score.` However, if a student takes the test more than once, it is represented in another row instead of `first name, last name, first score, second score.` Example:

     John, Smith, 80
     Sally, Williams, 90
     John, Smith, 100

I am using  `openpyxl` to read the excel data row by row and am creating `Student` objects from their name and score and then adding each `Student` object to the `class_of_students` object . But in this case of John Smith who has took this test twice, the next time I incur this name I do not need to create another `Student` object, I simply need to grab the score and add it to the already existing object as it's `Student.score_second_attempt` value. Here is my attempt:

    from openpyxl import load_workbook
    path = 'workbooks/StudentReportCard - 03022021.xlsx'
    
    # Workbook object is created
    workbook = load_workbook(path)
    
    # Get workbook active sheet object from the active attribute
    sheet_obj = workbook.active
    
    # initialize object that will hold all Student objects
    class_of_students= ClassOfStudents() 
    
    # Create Student objects and add them to class_of_students
    for i in range(1, 3):
        first_name = sheet_obj.cell(row = i, column = 2).value
        last_name = sheet_obj.cell(row =i, column = 1).value
        score = sheet_obj.cell(row = i, column= 3).value
        
    
        student_obj = Student(last_name, first_name) # create student object
    
        # if there are no Student objects in class_of_students object, add the first one
        if not class_of_students_obj.students:
            class_of_students.add_student(student_obj)
    
        # loop through class_of_students, if student is already included in class_of_students do not add this iterations student_obj, just discard it
        for student in class_of_students_obj.students:
            if student.first_name == first_name and student.last_name == last_name:
                pass 
                # logic for adding score_second_attempt would go here but this is not working
            else:
                class_of_students_obj.add_student(student_obj)

If I run this `class_of_students` contains 3 objects(John is created twice) instead of 2, so this is not working. Thanks for any help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a project and I want to include existing CPP code in my python package.

It's quite a lot of code, so I don't want to re-implement everything from scratch.

The first thing is the fact that the CPP code is quite old - it was implemented about 5 years ago, it uses three main libraries (OpenCV version 2.4, Glog version 0.3.3, Boost version 1.54.0), and idk if I should adjust the code to the newest version of libraries or to use current version because even if I will do that, after a for example year, it will need another refresh to be optimal.

Next thing is, how can I wrap that code into a python package? I was reading about [Extending Python with C or C++](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#a-simple-example), but I'm confusing how to apply that in my project, maybe there is a better way to wrap existing cpp code into python?

I am trying to learn python with no CIS background. I was able to learn a modest amount of VBA. I really enjoyed the fact that when you start typing functions into the excel editor, suggestions on function names and syntax would appear to help you find what you're looking for. It makes it really easy to learn functions by just messing around - which is how I learn best.

I downloaded Python3.9 and while I was able to figure out how to use the print function, when I type ""pr..."" there isn't any indicator that the function I'm looking for might be Print(""string"") or anything like that. I guess I'm looking for a Notepad-esque text editor that also will run the code in a similar way Excel's macro editor works? Is this something that exists for Python? 

Preferably I'm looking for something free and that won't make me install a million modules or libraries to make this happen (preferably it'll have an easy enough setup I can just download and install one thing without needing a lot of configuration knowledge). Obviously afterwards if I need a more specialized library, it'll probably be after I've learned enough of the fundementals that I can move on to a more advanced editor (IDE? UI? I'm not really sure what this is actually called).

I need to create a function that determines whether a number is a Kaprekar number. In case you don't know about these numbers, I'll summarize:

&amp;#x200B;

A Kaprekar number is a number that when you multiply by itself and split the digits from the new number, you can calculate the sum of those 2 digits and it will end up with your first number. For example: 9 is a Kaprekar number because 9 \* 9 = 81 and 8 + 1 = 9.

So now for the problem. I tried reproducing that in a python script. I've done the first few steps with creating the list, and now if I put that 9 in the script the list will give me \[8,1\], just as needed. Now I need to take both of these digits out and to be able to add them up. So first question: how can I take a list I have just created and take the digits out? All of that of course to be able to add both of them together to check if the first number is Kaprekar number.

Second question:  17 344 is also a Kaprekar number. Now as you probably know 17 344 \*\* 2 will give the list much more digits than 9 \*\* 2. What should I do to consider the increase in the digits that will be in the list? I was thinking about a while loop that would take out all those digits from the list, but still, after a bit of thinking, I feel like I'm missing something important there. The function won't necessarily know what digits to take out to create 2 new numbers... Or am I wrong? Is there a way to ""teach"" that list what digits to take?

I'm kind of lost here, any help would be great!

Thanks a lot guys

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*EDIT\*\*

This is the code I currently have that allows me to take the digits and put them in a list:

 

def is\_kaprekar\_number(num):   
  liste = \[\]  
  num = num \*\* 2  
  while num &gt; 0:  
liste.append(num % 10)  
liste.reverse()  
num = int(num / 10)

So my still script which is still a WIP has a main file that loads the XML (and the name of the output file) and imports each major section of the report (there will be about 10). 

Here are the relevant code blocks:

Import Report Components that I created (**main\_file.py**)

    	fabric_node_membership_doc = fabric_node_membership.write_fabric_node_membership(xmldoc=mydoc, template=word_template_body)

    	fabric_access_policies_doc = fabric_access_policies.write_fabric_access_policies(xmldoc=mydoc, template=word_template_body)

Put  Everything Together at the end (still **main\_file.py**):

Each of the modules then imports many of the same items (document, helper functions, pandas).

A blank doc-x document, as well as the entire XML config file is passed to each component file, and then each component file is further broken up into one function per section in the report.

The task is to ""write a program to find out how often a streak of six heads or a streak of six tails comes up in a randomly generated list of heads and tails."" Specificially, we want to perform 10,000 experiments, each with 100 coin flips, and then ""find out what percentage of the coin flips \[i.e.  what percentage of the iterations of the experiment\] contains a streak of six heads or tails in a row.""

The project instructions are laid out in full at the end of the [chapter](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/).

My code is as follows:

    import random
    numberOfStreaks = 0
    
    for experimentNumber in range(10000):
        # Code that creates a list of 100 'heads' or 'tails' values.

I always get the ouput `Chance of streak: 0.0%`.

I think the `numberOfStreaks += 1` line is never executed, but I don't know why not.

56,RespondsWithSciFi,1612170533,l9z2me,10,1,"I'm working on making a character class for an RPG game that is moddable via config files. The goal of this is to enable players to add custom items that can add new types of stats that behave in interesting ways. I'm doing this for fun/because I thought it would be a good way to dive deeper into Python than I have before.

One way I've been exploring is to have an init method that iterates through a dictionary to create class attributes, i.e. 

(Idk why reddit removes my double underscores)
&gt;class Char:
&gt;
&gt;    def __init__(self, **blueprint):
&gt;
&gt;        for key in blueprint:
&gt;
&gt;            setattr(self, key, blueprin[key])

If I pass  {'fort':0,'lvl':1} to create an instance of Char, I can call instance.lvl or instance.fort to return those values.

I would then like to accept configuration options that add math relating one or more variables. Say I would like to allow the config file to specify a self.hp stat which, defined by .5*self.lvl + self.fort.

I was thinking I could implement a __getattr__ and __setattr__ function for the class that 

1) takes an instance of the class (or should I be using the class?)
2) a stat name and some values (m,x,b) loaded from a config file to a function I can use in place of calling @property above a static function.

For instance, a function like this would attemtp to treat strings as attributes and pull out a corresponding integer from the instance. (assume valid config files that include only integers and strings corresponding to attributes with integers assigned to them)

&gt;def func(inst, m, x, b):
&gt;
&gt;    if type(m) == str:
&gt;
&gt;        m = getattr(inst, m)
&gt;
&gt;    if type(x) == str:
&gt;
&gt;        x = getattr(inst, x)
&gt;
&gt;    if type(b) == str:
&gt;
&gt;        b = getattr(inst, b)
&gt;
&gt;    result = m*x+b
&gt;

Perhaps I could implement something that calls the function above, passing the values for m,x,b and some string  that stores a string associated with the new property name?

For instance to get the desired hp attribute which is set to 0.5*lvl+fort:

&gt;config = {'name': 'hp', 'func': {'m':0.5,'x':'lvl','b':'fort'}}
&gt;
&gt;name = config['name']
&gt;
&gt;func_key = config['func']
&gt;
&gt;setattr(self, name, func(inst=self,**func_key))

59,R3D3-1,1612172065,l9zfaw,0,1,"I was wondering if there are experiences with auto-import implementations.

What I have tried to far:

* `importmagic`. Seems the be the standard go-to solution for editor integrations, but its last release has been a while. 

    Most notably, it trips over new syntax like assignment expressions (`:=`); `if m := re.match(""foo"",""bar""): print (m)` will cause it to consider `m` a missing import.

* `autoimport`. Seems to be more up to date and can be used from the command line, so adding editor-integration myself is trivial. 

    However, it crashes when encountering imports that are not fully qualified. E.g.

        x = os.path.exists(""foo"") # will cause ""import os"" to be added.
        x = exists(""foo"") # will cause it to crash.

    It is a relatively minor issue, since I *mostly* prefer fully qualified
    names, but for data analysis applications it can be annoying:

      * It will not produce `from numpy import sin`.

65,FreeSport69,1612175488,la08fo,16,3,"Hey all,

I was given an exercise to solve for an interview I was having which I cannot get my head around.  
I submitted it partially solved and I wanted to see if someone here has any creative idea how to solve it.

The goal is to find the average work hours of each employee per day by analyzing a log file.

\- The actions that are logged are log-in, log-out, deposit, withdraw, phone-call.  
\- Each employee has a unique ID  
A line in the log looks like this:    
`16:27:48 [3247] deposit`  
where 16:27:48 is the time that the action was performed.    
the part \[3247\] is the employee’s unique id inside \[ \]    
and the word ‘deposit’ at the end of the line is the name of the action

A sample from the log file looks like this:

    07:35:30 [6633] log-in
    08:06:42 [8749] log-in
    08:38:06 [1265] log-in
    17:30:33 [8465] phone-call
    17:32:13 [6633] log-out
    17:52:16 [8749] log-out

So I reached a point where I successfully extracted only the relevant lines (the lines with 'log-in' and 'log-out' in them) and mapped them to each employee id like so:

    {'1026': ['14:44:29 [1026] log-in',
              '22:22:44 [1026] log-out',
              '15:03:04 [1026] log-in',
              '01:10:30 [1026] log-out'],
    
     '1117': ['11:24:03 [1117] log-in',
              '20:30:36 [1117] log-out',
              '11:23:44 [1117] log-in',
              '21:11:39 [1117] log-out']}

The point where I got stuck at, is how should I iterate over each employee's hours so I will be able to calculate the average. As far as I understand, I need to iterate over the hours in pairs and then append the result of (log-out) - (log-in) (?).

I have created a function that extracts the time (hh:mm:ss) using regex and converts it to seconds, so that's not my problem.

Today I had a conversation with a guy who is leading a data science/ML team in my company. Being that I am still just starting to use Python (9 months / ~6 online courses) I wanted to know whether there is a chance to get a junior position without leaving my current place of work. It was a risk because I am not that long in this company and also because I knew I could end up being demotivated by my current skill level. And that is partly what happened. Even though the guy was very friendly, I realized I am just a noob compared to the guys that are doing this kind of work on a daily basis.

I have covered the basics of Python (file handling, utils) and have gone to areas such as web-scraping and automation (scrapy, selenium), data analytics &amp; visualization (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), but now I understand I need to up my SQL game, since I used it very lightly and had one or two courses, but never hands-on experience. I also need to learn about machine learning and algorhitms and decide if I want to move in the direction of ML/data science or obj. oriented programming and sw development. Either way, I think SQL would be beneficial. I am just not sure if I will have the motivation to endure learning it...

Hi there. I want to make a simple(?) web app / (maybe android too) using Python but I'm a beginner and it will be my first project - I'm basically wondering if my idea is feasible.

I've be studying Python for a month or two using the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. I'm about half way through and think I have a decent idea on the basics now. My plan is to continue this book and complete the projects at the end (especially the web app one).

However, I have a simple app idea for a first solo project once I'm finished the book which involves the following:

* A very basic, turn-based multiplayer board game-type feature where multiple players see the same game status and all can interact on their turn.
* Users register and stats sync to their account relating to performance

Does the above sound possible?

What would be needed for this with regards to having it available to others online?

Could I do all this for free?

I am willing to commit a decent amount of time to it and it is mainly for learning purposes, though I want it to be usable online with a few friends at the end. If it is feasible / possible, how long do you think it might take?

I've got a simple list with 5 entries.  For each entry, I want to print the last 5 characters of the string.  This is my example:

    list = [""hello1"",""hello2"",""hello3"",""hello4"",""hello5""]
    
    for a in list:
        print(a[-1]) 

This works perfectly fine, and successfully prints:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

However, when I alter the print to a range (still in the negatives) to this:

    list = [""hello1"",""hello2"",""hello3"",""hello4"",""hello5""]
    
    for a in list:
        print(a[-6:-1])

The output is:

    hello
    hello
    hello
    hello
    hello

Why is the number at the very end the string missing? -1 should be the very last character, but for some reason, when I use it in a range, it's as if it's the second-to-last character?

99,synthphreak,1612192464,la5b25,30,1,"Title is probably unclear. Sorry about that. I assume this is not possible, but figured I'd ask here.

Say I have two iterable objects like the following:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; l = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]    # list
    &gt;&gt;&gt; d = { 1: 'a',   2: 'b',   3: 'c'}     # dict

You can see that the iterables are almost the same, except that they're different data structures.

Say that I want to create a for loop that loops through one of these objects and unpacks each item in the for loop line (like `for key, value in dict.items()`), but doesn't know in advance which of the two iterables it will be. Here's a super contrived example:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; from random import shuffle
    &gt;&gt;&gt; iterables = [l, d]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; shuffle(iterables)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for iterable in iterables:
    ...     for ... in iterable:    # b/c of shuffle, we don't know which iterable it is
    ...         # loop body

Because the iterables are different data structures, the same for loop syntax won't work for both:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i, j in iterable:            # with only work if `iterable` == `l`
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i, j in iterable.items():    # will only work if `iterable` == `d`

Of course, I could just do something like the following:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for iterable in iterables:
    ...     if isinstance(iterable, list):
    ...         for i, j in iterable:        # this is what i'm calling the ""for loop line"", btw
    ...             # loop body
    ...     else:
    ...         for i, j in iterable.items():
    ...             # loop body

However putting `isinstance` before the for loop line requires that `loop body` be duplicated. My `loop body` is pretty long, so in the interest of keeping my code DRY, I'm wondering if there is a better way to do this.

Specifically, I'm wondering if it's possible to essentially put the `isinstance`( or similar) condition within the actual for loop line itself, so that my code can dynamically route the iterable to the correct logic. Something like the following:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i, j in iterable if isinstance(iterable, list) else for i, j in iterable.items():
    ...     # loop body

This way, I'd only have to write `loop body` one time, and the condition in the for loop line will route each iterable to the correct unpacking syntax.

Is there some way to do this? I really, really want to avoid duplicating `loop body` since everything will be shared between the two iterables _except_ how their contents gets unpacked...

**Edit:** I suppose I could add a line right before the loop which would convert the iterables to all be of the same structure prior to the for loop line:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for iterable in iterables:
    ...     if instance(iterable, dict):
    ...         iterable = {(k, v) for k, v in dict.items()]
    ...     for i, j in iterable:
    ...         # loop body

But my iterables are quite massive, and essentially recreating half of them like this would incur a lot of extra processing time, so this isn't ideal either.",learnpython,"Given two iterables and a for loop, possible to determine which iterable to loop through based on condition?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/la5b25/given_two_iterables_and_a_for_loop_possible_to/

When adding functionality to the UI, like functions when buttons are pressed, where do I write them? The tutorial I am following is writing them in the from userInterface.ui to [userInterface.py](https://example.py) converted file, but when I will make changes later in QtDesign and import the file again, all the functionality gets deleted of course.

So my question is, where do I write the functionality so I dont overwrite it later? Do i make a seperate [functionality.py](https://functionality.py) file which connects to my userInterface.py?

Quick run down, this thread isn't meant for anything serious, no need to criticize someone elses code, unless they ask or give users the OK, this thread is intended to be light hearted, and all in good fun.

In this thread anything goes,

Whether you want to show your ""bad"" code, and improving it to ""better"" code

a small piece of code you got a laugh out of when you wrote it.

or a piece of code from that one night when you asked yourself ""Whats the most ridiculous way I can write ""hello world"" python script?"" 

what ever it is, post it if you want to!

Please follow learnpython rules for formatting code, I would recommend large chunks of code being linked from pastebin or any other paste like websites provided in the wiki.

In my opinion I would say code written in less than 15 lines would be fine to directly post in the thread, to help keep it clean.

I think it's not the fear of making it not perfect, but I start to build a basic guessing game, and start to ask questions. Which leads me to google, which leads me to edit the code and then further google something. A basic class, that I'm using to manage gamestate of a guessing game, turns into an all day thing. 

I'm studying about gamestate, instance attributes vs class attributes, decorators, what is property, etc,. 

This is all that's been taking up my time. So I've been lost in the sauce. This leads me to my question. How do you know when it's time to build out a class. I see a lot of youtube vids that devs just throw everything into a class that seem to maintain a semblance of single responsibility. But it seems like there is no maintenance of state.

I thought best way to know if you need to build a class is if you are interacting with a database, dictionary, list, etc,. Between functions. 

Example:

FuncA receives input from user.
Checks a dic or list to see if the user had inputted that before. If not, add to the list/dic. 
FuncB reference the above dic/list to display data to the user. 

In the above instance, wouldn't it be best to have a class. To encapsulate everything that is occuring.

Just started on python a few days ago. I am a slow learner, but I decided to try and make something useful to help cement the few things I managed to grasp.

I started out trying to make a decimal to binary converter, but in my muddling, I ended up making what I *think* is a working binary to decimal converter.

Over the last few days, and a lot of headscratching, I did a lot of trimming down and am happy with how few lines it took me.

Please point out a simpler/entirely different way of accomplishing this, or just point at it and laugh.  I'm still proud of me though. 

I tried to limit googling, aside from the logic behind binary to decimal conversions. Granted that is about the point where I started making some progress.

This function returns a list of random numbers. That part is easy. There is a condition, however. Adjacent numbers can't be more than *n* digits (`macs`) apart. So, I check the last element of the list against the new random number to ensure it meets the condition. If not, call the function to try again.

    import random
    
    def random_bitting(num_of_cuts, depths, macs, cuts):
         random_cut = random.randrange(1, depths + 1)
         if len(cuts) == 0:
             cuts.append(random_cut)

The function works as intended but it seems clunky. Would it be better to use global variables to store the data, or make it a class and use class variables?

I'm trying a really cool GitHub project that I just barely understand how to get working. It's https://github.com/shubham-goel/ucmr/ 

It uses matplotlib and seems to be capable of converting 2D images to 3D meshes.

When I run their demo script, a 3D mesh file isn't created on my computer. I'd like it to be. 

I can make it create an image of what looks like a 3D mesh file by adding this line to their demo.py:

    plt.savefig('filename.png')

and then I get this pretty image saved on my computer: https://i.imgur.com/tt03wUI.png

It feels like it should be possible to add yet another line of code that, instead of an image, saves a 3D mesh in obj or slt or ply or whatever 3D format.

Does anyone have suggestions on what code can be tried?

Here's the method in question:

        # Different viewpoints.
        vp1 = renderer.diff_vp(
            vert, cam, angle=30, axis=[0, 1, 0], texture=texture, extra_elev=True)[0]
        vp2 = renderer.diff_vp(
            vert, cam, angle=60, axis=[0, 1, 0], texture=texture, extra_elev=True)[0]
        vp3 = renderer.diff_vp(
            vert, cam, angle=60, axis=[1, 0, 0], texture=texture)[0]

        img = np.transpose(img, (1, 2, 0))

        plt.figure(1)
        plt.clf()

Hi firstly i'm not that's good in english so sorry for mistake i'm learning ....

Secondly i'm a beginer in rainmeter and in python, i just programmed some few litle things at school with VB.net .

So i did a little program to switch virtual desktop with a custom shortcut. It works very simply by using bang command (windows option for launching rainmeter by command )  to start a rainmeter layout when i switch from virtual desktop with my shortcut. Very simple but i needed to built it myself because i couldn't find it on internet.

I have one probleme, i run my python script with pythonw as a background process, and sometimes after few using of my shortcut it stops working, so if you have clue you can share it, i'll be thanksfull.

So that's the code : 

Afrom pynput import keyboard

from pyvda import GetCurrentDesktopNumber, GoToDesktopNumber

import os

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

COMBINATIONS = \[

{keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode(char='A')},

{keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode(char='a')}

\]

&amp;#x200B;

current = set()

&amp;#x200B;

def execute():

if GetCurrentDesktopNumber() == 1:

GoToDesktopNumber(2)

os.system('start D:\\logi\\Rainmeter.exe !LoadLayout ""d2""')

else:

GoToDesktopNumber(1)

os.system('start D:\\logi\\Rainmeter.exe !LoadLayout ""d1""')

I originally started by installing anaconda/Jupiter to follow along with a course I bought but I didn’t really like that system and other videos I was watching were using Pycharm, so I switched to that. I think this move messed up the path already though I forgot exactly what kind of problems I ran into. 

I tried to correct it by installing Homebrew, which I thought that would fix the path and automatically update Python and always keep pointing any IDE toward the right path to find the most current version. I can’t actually tell if that happened correctly or not.

That seemed to work but then I decided to move the directory where my project files are located to a more suitable location and now Pycharm seems to have a problem running the code. It can open my .py files and the code is intact but I get some sort of directory error at runtime. 

At this point I don’t know if the path is the problem or the project save directory or both. Can someone please help me untangle this mess I’ve created?

I have been using JupyterLab to write some simple scripts and also plot data.

Before jupyter I was using mainly matplotlib for static plots and dived briefly into Bokeh to make some nice charts with buttons that allowed me to slice my dataset and plot specific parts of it.

Since jupyter I got overwhelmed by info about \*plotly\*, \*hvplot\*, \*holoviews\* and \*bokeh\*. At this point I do not know what they do and how they differentiate from each other. Similarly I got tons of errors trying to install jupyter labextensions that I never got to solve, beacuse some of thos libraries require some extra stuff regarding nodejs.

So, I wonder, what is there for a beginner that can allow me to plot my data. My data is mainly a pandas dataframe with multiple columns. The table reports the data oh each column and different coordinates in space (x,y,z) and time.

In my first dive into `Bokeh` I managed to make som simple plots where I displayed a parameter along one of the axis (i.e. x) at time=0. A button callback allowed me to change the time and would update the contents of the plot.

Can I move my bokeh plots and interactions to Jupyter. Is Jupyter not a good place for Bokeh? should I stick to Holoviews?",learnpython,Is it possible to have interactive plots in Jupyter lab?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/k594dj/is_it_possible_to_have_interactive_plots_in/

Should I log every instance of the script to check if database query went ok? If API connection went ok? What are the good practices on this matter? Or how should I Google them (tried, but failed)

        result = result[:result.find('""'):]

I have a large Excel file (3M rows), and because the report is so big, Excel spread it cross 3 Sheets (Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3). I need to see how many rows are duplicated and I would like to use Python for that purpose. I went as far as getting the number of duplicated rows in the first Sheet using below code:

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel('Dup test.xlsx')
    print(df.duplicated().sum())

I am however completely in the dark as to how to calculate the number of duplicated rows across the entire Excel file (all three Sheets). I have tried multiple methods to include all 3 Sheets in the pd.read\_excel command I have found online but nothing seems to work.

Could anyone explain how do I import all three Sheets to run a duplicate check and return the number of duplicated rows, please?

2. How can I learn to create a better system for game saving? I'd like to export the state of all game objects to file, but I'm not sure how. My idea was to export as a text file using repr's then load back in with literal\_eval... but it seems like that won't work.
3. How can learn to make it so that players can skip past animated text by pressing enter? **EG**\- If text is animating on screen, I'd like for the player to be able to hit enter and then for all of the text to appear immediately on screen.

I encourage people to find their own text/images/fonts and create their own designs, as the ones used in my examples have probably been used to death.

Don’t be turned off if you happen to miss the sale. Due to the sheer amount of designs you’ll be able to upload with minimal effort, the chances of making a sale is extremely high and the script will pay for itself in just a sale or two.

What I want is a triangle with slightly longer sides but equal on the left and right. I want the triangle to point upwards like most do.

    x = self.target_location     
    points = np.array([[x, 10], [x/2, 10], [x+1/2, np.sqrt(5**2 - 2**2)]])     
    pivot = plt.Polygon(points, closed = True)

The data i get gives me information on every tiktok video i have whereas i only need data from ONE video. And the only data i need is the amount of likes it has, or in the data that is return to me, it is refereed to as ""diggCount"". I've done a lot of research over the last few hours and tried different methods however I am getting no where.

Here is my current code, it grabs the data and displays it fine, i just need a little help filtering out the likes from a single video.

I know this kind of questions have been asked a lot in this reddit and I read a lot but still I haven't be able to get the answer for me.

I want to learn Python, it looks like a really great language and I'm really interested about all the possibilities that offers for automation/machine learning and stuff.

So, I want to know which course would be better for my, I really read a lot and saw the ""preview videos"" of each one, but still can't decide.

There's some courses that looks good but are too old (mostly 2015) and I know they update but if you check the last reviews some people say there are still a lot of outdated stuff (even websites that doesn't look like before making harder to accomplish the exercises).

I'm also learning WebDev, actually I'm doing Angela Yu Bootcamp Udemy course, so It'll be great if the Python one have some kind of WebDev stuff.

These are the courses I think I'll be more suitable for what I'm looking for:

[Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery - Andrei Neagoie](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/)  
I thought of this one because have it have a lot of automation and web stuff applied to real world situations, and it's a 2019 course so it up to date. Sadly, there some reviews saying the tutor isn't really good explaining and even struggle sometimes with the code ""trial and error"".

[The Complete Python Programmer Bootcamp 2020 - Giles McMullen-Klein](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-programmer-bootcamp/)  
This one I like the tutor the most, looks easy to understand and use a lot of animated graphics to explain, that kind of stuff helps me a lot, plus is a 2019 course so it's up to date too. Sadly, I think the course is related to ""Research"" and not so much to build real world stuff (and none of WebDev). Correct me if I'm wrong, please.

[The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications - Ardit Sulce](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)  
I like this one because It teaches a lot of programs that I think I'll help me to understand real world applications, also have a bunch of web related stuff, but I'm not sure if have something about machine learning. This one is 2015 so in the reviews you can see there are some persons saying that there are old videos and some websites doesn't look like in the video.

There are **way more** but this post is really long already, so if you can suggest any other it'll great 🙂

Sorry If write something wrong or I sounded rude at any moment (that isn't my intention), my english isn't really good 😕

**TL;DR**: What's a good, up to date, Python course for a beginner?

I know I'm making a big deal of this, but in my country (Venezuela) it isn't easy to get those $10-12 that an Udemy course cost, so I just want to do everything right to learn and do a good investment. I just want to become a programmer and work doing anything that can help me escape this country.

I've tried joining a bunch of groups on Facebook but they are all terrible. A couple of times I found one that seemed decent, but within a month or so they usually devolve into people asking things like ""how can I hack facebook?"" or ""how can I learn Python"". It's fine if you're a beginner and don't know where to start but the FB groups seem to be literally just a bunch of people posting low effort questions because they can't be bothered using Google. I even saw one where a girl was literally just copying screenshots from an online exam she was taking, asking for answers.. So ideally something that isn't that, if it exists, would be wonderful.

Obviously I'm no wizard either, and my Python skills are very basic, so any advanced groups are probably out of the question for me, too. I'd love a group where challenging questions are asked and answered that actually have a sense of community, rather than just a dumping ground for questions.

And after some googling it seems the CPython core developers actively discourage users from adding python to PATH partly due to security concerns. (Assuming I’m reading this right, it’s above my level of understanding.)

“The real problem with modifying PATH is it enables (intentional or unintentional) DLL hijacking (see CVE-2020-8315 for example, which essentially requires a PATH modification to exploit). To fix this, we’d have to remove all the DLLs from the directory on PATH, which isn’t really feasible.”

So how can I detect for duplicate, prevent the program from using that duplicate, take 1 count off the counter. I

This question relates to the ""xxx"" out of ""xxx"" statement when you run the code. I have figured that the program doesn't detect for duplicates and executes the same combination even though it may have already been used. So that's why the count exceeds the TOTAL POSSIBLE combinations, because the program reiterates or duplicates the same combinations without knowing.

Previously I had a nested for loop but like the comment above the second loop says, I kept getting errors because after finishing it would start at the outer loop again. 

I changed up my code and got rid of the nested loop, by utilizing global. I am in no way a fan of this but alas. 

The rest of my code works fine (logging in, navigating, gathering the url's) but for some reason the second For loop only opens the last order(url) from a list with 10 entries.  

Flow of what im aiming for: all orders are gathered (urls) -&gt; navigate to the first order in the list - &gt; open chat -&gt; send message -&gt; close tab -&gt; open new tab with second order -&gt; send message. Etc.

I hope this is the right place to post this, if not please feel free to remove.

I have this online portal that I'm currently logging into with a username and password. 

from that portal, I direct myself to a reporting section. 

There are a few dropdowns to select some specific items. 

After I select what I would like to see, you have the option to export as an Excel or CSV file. 

I did notice however you can export this as a Refreshable WebQuery. 

For some reason though when I choose this option the data never refreshes in the Excel file that it pulled that data source into. I'm consistently getting a time out error from the request. 

The format of the data that I would be exporting is a table with multiple pages you can cycle through. When you do export to excel, it exports all the pages. 

Is there a way I can make this pull request for this data with Python? 

I may find myself having to log in to the service?

I first tried using the URL of the refreshable WebQuery but I got hit with an Unauthorized message on the pull. 

At first, I tried the following:

import requests

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs

headers = {

'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36',

}

url = 'Refreshable WebQuery address' 

get\_data = requests.get(url, headers = headers)

soup = bs(get\_data.content, 'html.parser'

print(soup)

my response was:

\&gt;&gt;&gt; Unauthorized

Or instead of a circle, its a squiggly line that functions the same was as before. If there is no x or circle, it's just a flat line. It is possible to graph something like this?

Part of my job is comparing data between databases (e.g. test vs UAT) but more often than not they use different database types (e.g. SQL Server vs oracle). I've gotten up to the Functions chapter in my python book and think I've found a great use case for them. The code below reads a csv containing credentials (username, password, server, etc.) on my personal drive and from it creates a dictionary of dictionaries for each credential saved. It then connects to one database, runs a query and stores in a dataframe, does the same thing for another database/query, then concats and dedupes and write the output to a csv. Originally the 'datatbase_connect_setup' function was much simpler and just used what I have saved in my ODBC, but I've found sqlalchemy doesn't behave for certain connection types so I separated into oracle/sql server/postgres connection logic (and yes I know reading credentials from a personal driver isn't exactly secure).

97,jus_an_engineer,1604341353,jmt0sm,2,1,"So I am building a service that has a bunch of integrations like AWS S3, Databases. We use a config file to set the config for the above integrations. I have individual classes for each of integrations and my main entry point parses all the configs from the file stores it in the main pipeline class and then sends it over to the individual classes when they are used. So the code kinda looks like this

**Individual Integration classes**

`db.py`

    class DB:
        def __init__(self, host):
            self.host = host

`s3.py`

    class S3:
        def __init__(self, bucket):
            self.bucket = bucket

Then there is the pipeline class which does a bunch of tasks sequentially and uses the integration

`pipeline.py`

    class Pipeline:
        def __init__(self, db_host, s3_bucket):
            self.db_host = db_host
            self.s3_bucket = s3_bucket
        
        def run(self):
            s3 = S3(self.s3_bucket)
            s3.upload()
    
            db = DB(self.db_host)
            db.upload()

The `main.py` file parses the config file and then initializes the Pipeline class with all the configs which then makes individual integrations objects with their configs. Something like this.

    config = parse_config()
    Pipeline = Pipeline(config.db_host, config.s3_bucket)

This way of doing things this way seems very weird because I am parsing all config at first then passing it to Pipeline which is responsible for doing tasks and then passing individual config to class when they are needed.

Is there a better way of passing config to individual config to classes so that I do not have to pass a bunch of config to Pipeline?

**Store what you need:**  
We need to use the column and row indices you identified in Step 1 to extract the data we need from the table that was provided in the CSV file (and subsequently stored in Python as data\_list in Step 0).  
In the second cell in the Jupyter notebook, you will see the following steps:  
1. Define the status labels, in the same order we will be using them throughout the analysis.  
2. Extract the total number of adults in the US from the data table.  
• QUESTION 1: What is the data type of total\_US\_adults? If it is a list, what type of objects does it contain?  
1. Extract the total number of adults in the US with each marital status from the data table.  
• QUESTION 2: What is the data type of total\_US\_status? If it is a list, what type of objects does it contain?  
1. Extract the total number of adults in the south region from the data table.  
2. Extract the total number of adults in the south region with each marital status from the data table.  
3. Use the numerators and denominators we’ve obtained in the previous steps to compute the percent of the adult population (in the US and the south, respectively) with each marital status.  
• QUESTION 3: What is the data type of percent\_south\_status? If it is a list, what type of objects does it contain?  
• QUESTION 4: Where do the 3, 2, 9, 4, 10, 74, and 81 indices come from? Explain each one and what its purpose is.

I have a bit of a query and I cant seem to find the answer.

Im looking at developing a local 'off internet' network of around 10 machines.

The machines will all need to authenticate users based on username/password info. The key though is that the machines will NOT be able to authenticate by querying the server, as they have no WiFi capabilities, so must be able to 'self' authenticate.

The idea is that 1 machine will act as host and store all hashed passwords and salts, this will be inaccesible to all users except 1 admin. The host will accept data from the other machines which are effectively encrypted 'task logs'. It will deploy the hashed password/salt table to each laptop daily to ensure if passwords change that users can still send valid encrypted data, as the encrypted messages will be based on their hashed password.

However, I dont want to store the hashed passwords in a basic text file, and wondered, is there a password 'repository' that can run locally on each machine, that purely acts as a sink. It accepts a hashed password input and username and if correct, returns True, if not, returns False.

This 'repository' can only be updated by the host to prevent these passwords being accessed easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping someone here can help me out, I have debugged this every which way I can think of, had another co-worker look at it with me, and can't understand why this is happening.. 

Pastebin: [https://pastebin.com/xpyxHMUg](https://pastebin.com/xpyxHMUg)

Basically, I build a dict object of a test case containing the details of the test and the url that needs called to perform the test. I use asyncio and aiohttp to asynchronously call a function using that object, the function updates the ""result"" key value pair to be what response we got to the url. I then gather all the tasks and parse them for output. For some reason the dict eventually gets messed up as it runs through the asyncio process.. If I debug what is passed into the task/function it looks good, if I debug what is being returned the server field eventually doesn't match the rest of the object. Note, I (so far at least) only see this when the server key's value is a DICT but that could just be a red herring.

Appreciate any help anyone can provide. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

I'm rather new to python and recently I've been encountering a strange error. 

I'm using kivy to create an app that will convert common kitchen measurements (like teaspoons to tablespoons, etc). I have a label that displays the results and a function that makes the calculation. 

In the calculation function I have a bunch of if/elif statements based on what units are selected to convert. I had about 8 or so of these options, and when I tested everything out it worked just fine: the function would run, make a calculation, and then display the result to the label. 

However, I as I continue to add options I'm now encountering the error ""local variable referenced before assignment."" 

It's unclear to me why this is happening now and not before. I'm using the same exact syntax as I continue to add different measurements; it's like as soon as I hit a certain number of elif statements the error just gets thrown no matter what.

I'm trying to make a python script that plays a game that exclusively supports gamepads.

Now, I'm stuck at how to emulate the input of an Xbox Controller. I tried [pyxinput](https://www.google.com/search?q=pyxinput&amp;oq=pyxinput&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i60l3.2202j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), but the game won't detect it. I tried using it in conjunction with [X360ce](https://www.x360ce.com/#Help), but after having gone through each sensible option in it, the game still won't detect the gamepad.

Moreover, now not even my normal bluetooth-connected (XBOX)controller is detected by the game.

Another approach I thought of was using the great [integration of AutoHotKeys](https://pypi.org/project/ahk/) with python to feed macros composed of controller inputs. Alas, there's only support for Keyboard and Mouse.

I'm completely at a loss, so I come here for help. Is there any way I can emulate a gamepad so this(and most Windows games) will accept it without fuss? Can I do it in python? If not, how do I go about writing something(in Rust/C) that would make this process painless? And on that note, would extending ahk make more sense?

P.S: yes, I think this should be much easier to do on linux, but as my main goal is to interface with a majority of games, Windows is almost necessary(Wine can run most games, but my googling says it'll also suffer from the same lack of packages problem).",learnpython,[Question] In a pythonic code hell trying to emulate an Xbox controller.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/j4670q/question_in_a_pythonic_code_hell_trying_to/

However, I would like to customize it alittle bit so it can take some input from myself, and then forward the message, but due to this async await thing, i am not managing to do it right which is a little bit awkard.. therefore i am asking for help.

*import* asyncio  


    class WebSocketClient():

 def __init__(self):
 pass

    async def connect(self):
 self.connection = await websockets.client.connect('ws://134.122.76.213:5080/ws/testchannel')
 if self.connection.open:
 print('Connection stablished. Client correcly connected')
 await self.sendMessage('Hey server, i am acting as a WS client for my MQTT client! :)')
 return self.connection

    async def receive_data_into_client(self, yoo):
 print(yoo)
        forward_message = await self.sendMessage(yoo)
 return forward_message

    async def sendMessage(self, message):
 await self.connection.send(message)

    async def receiveMessage(self, connection):
 while True:
 try:
 message = await connection.recv()
 print('Received message from server: ' + str(message))
 except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
 print('Connection with server closed')
 break

    async def ping_pong(self, connection):
 while True:
 try:
 await connection.send('ping')
 await asyncio.sleep(5)
 except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
 print('Connection with server closed')
 break

&amp;#x200B;

and here is my [main.py](https://main.py) which i switched the line ""if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':"" with a function:

    def run_connection():
 client = WebSocketClient()

       client.receive_data_into_client(""this came in, right?"")
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

       connection = loop.run_until_complete(client.connect())

       tasks = [
        asyncio.ensure_future(client.ping_pong(connection)),
        asyncio.ensure_future(client.receiveMessage(connection)),
    ]

       loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(tasks))

    run_connection()

  
I would love to be able to type in message and put it into the class before forwarding message as i am also planning to integrate this with an MQTT broker later sometime!

That's the normal behaviour that I know and I'm used to. var only exists inside of the function. I don't return anything, so ""a"" stays the same.

    a = 11

        var = 22

So I'm picking up Python again after maybe 6 months? Noticed something odd which I haven't seen before.

On typing this..

    python --version

    python -v

Basically has no output, cmd just moves to the next line as if I had pressed 'Enter'

Even just typing

    python

has the same effect.

This is my first time working with data and doing analytics, i'm the only technical person in the analyst teams where the rest of the interns come from a business background, so they usually analyse with excel and pull simple SQL queries etc.

It's been a month and i feel like i haven't made a significant impact with my work at the moment. Mainly because i spend A LOT of time data cleaning from the database and setting up the data before i visualize the data. Even when visualizing the data,i spent a lot of time trying to debug my code, ( working with dataframes is confusing for me :( ). 

I'm having imposter syndrome thoughts but i'm pushing on :')

I want to calculate the population is in a given cartesian quadrant (e.g., x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0), given a specified correlation coefficient. In mathematical terms, I can do this by calculating a double integral of an equation representing the bivariate normal distribution. How would I go about doing this in Python? I have a lot of Python experience, but using it do to math like this is totally foreign to me. My output needs to be a number, and I am fine with good approximations of the solution.

91,life_never_stops_97,1601735629,j4g0gs,7,1,"The use of filter, according to me requires a function and a sequence object. Filter then creates a filter object that will eventually be run to filter out those elements which the function returns true on each object in the sequence.

But, I have a lambda that takes two parameters, how do I run filter on lambda and that sequence?

My exact problem is: 

&amp;#x200B;

The lambda function is:

f = lambda div, keyword : div.attrs.get('class') and keyword in div.attrs.get('class')\[0\]

Where div would be a beautifulsoup element object and keyword would be a string. And the function f checks if the keyword is there in the class  attribute of div or not. 

And I have a collection of divs which I want to filter out with f.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I'd write a for loop like this:

`filtered_divs = list()`

`for div in divs:`

`if f(div):`

`filtered_divs.append(div)`

It's a spreadsheet usage tracking app that I built because I've always wondered how often the excel reports I make at work actually get used.

**(Plug over!)** For /r/learnpython I think what'd be most interesting is that this app was made completely using Python with minimal HTML/CSS knowledge. I used the [Dash library](https://dash.plotly.com/) combined with the [Dash-Bootstrap](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/) library to build the entire site (including callback logic).

It was a super interesting journey diving deep into a library that I  came across randomly and yielded probably the best website I've ever put together. And it was (relatively) painless.

I do think one challenge with this method is just how your frontend + backend logic gets all mish-mashed and I could feel that if the app was more complex or bigger, then it'd be impossible to easily iterate on it.

That could perhaps just be my sloppy work in terms of structuring the project, so I plan on making more projects with Dash + Dash-Bootstrap to see if things get better.

So two plans I have write now are:

---

**FIRST PLAN**

Application 1 allows for updates to the database through forms. Application 2 doesn't allow updating the database. So if you need to make updates you have to use Application 1.

**Upsides**:

- decoupling the applications

**Downsides**

- If need to perform updates for Application 2, have to log back into Application 1.

**SECOND PLAN**

Combine Application 1 and Application 2 into a single Application 0.

- database updates are all performed in one place

**Downsides**

- overlapping functionality that doesn't relate to each other

Just getting into asyncio python and am developping a small program using aiobravado library (the async version of Bravado - a Swagger client). I've got the program working but having some problems shutting down bravado's HTTP client at the end of execution. I've done some googling and found a solution where I can start the aioHttp client myself and tell bravado to use it (giving me a direct handle to the underlying http\_client) but only works when using `with Client as client:`  
I don't think I can do this as am using bravado client inside a class and want to keep the internals away from users. I assumed I could just find and close the Bravado http client from the bravado object, but don't seem to be able to access it.  


From the aioBravado module:

    @classmethod
    async def from_url(cls, spec_url, http_client=None, request_headers=None, config=None):
    
            http_client = http_client or AsyncioClient(run_mode=RunMode.FULL_ASYNCIO)
            ...

where AsyncioClient inherits from a pretty empty HTTPClient object. There doesn't seem to be any close() or shutdown methods avaiable in there.

I forsaw it might happen, but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to fix it. I searched around, but I only found some posts about how to redirect to a different view. I could add another admin.site.urls, but that would be dry, and having two links to the same page would be messy.

I am completely new to Python and React and have had trouble finding help/documentation online for what must surely be a very common and simple task - sending a Python List of my own object type through to a React front end using Flask.

Summary of goal: *Provide a list of Company objects to my React front end and display the name and address of the company.*

    class Company:
        def __init__(self,name,address):
            self.name = name
            self.address = address

        def toJson(self):
            return json.dumps(self, default=lambda o: o.__dict__)

    class Interface:
        def get_companies():
            companies = []

            companies.append(Company(""Microsoft"",""Redmond""))
            companies.append(Company(""Google"",""Mountain View""))

            return companies
            

The above is very dumbed down for sake of example. My version of the above is working exactly how I want it, so no problem so far.

In my Flask api code I have a route for retrieving the companies. It looks like this:

    @app.route('/companies')
    def get_companies():
        results = []
        companies = dbInterface.get_companys()

        for company in companies:
            companyData = json.dumps(company.toJson(), indent=4)
            results.append(companyData)

        return { ""results"" : results }

When I call this API from the front end, I can see that I am receiving an array of length 2 representing each company,  however rather than looking like clean JSON structure as I'd expect, it appears that each array item is a big string. Here is what the output looks like when I call it through Postman:

    {
        ""results"": [
             ""\""{\\\""name\\\"": \\\""Microsoft\\\"", \\\""address\\\"": \\\""Redmond 1\\\""}\"""", 
             ""\""{\\\""name\\\"": \\\""Google\\\"", \\\""address\\\"": \\\""Mountain View\\\""}\""""
        ]
     }

Since I've never done this before, I am not sure if it is normal to be so heavily escaped in serialized JSON like that.

In my React code I have no trouble addressing each of the two array items by using the map() function, however I don't know how to access the name / address fields.

I'm super happy with the way this turned out! Some exciting features include:

* The program breaks sentences at a space!
* It asks you how many characters per line you would like it to print;
* It has no problems with words that are longer than 'allowed' either, because those words get broken into pieces;
* It remembers the last 10 lines you've given it, until you exit the program;
* If a character isn't recognized, it will print an x instead of giving an error. 

I learned a LOT from making this. The most difficult thing was to get the letters to be printed right. It required 3 nested for loops. Took me a while to figure out how to do that.

93,DBBDG9,1599089125,ili38k,0,1,"Hey guys. I have two separate dataframes. They both have timestamps of each day over several years as the index. Each dataframe has two rows which are two different stocks  and their stockprices on each day (total of 4 stocks). On some days there is no stockprice available for one or both stocks in a dataframe, hence there are empty fields on some days. What I want to do now is to check the last valid stockprice for each year of the stocks in the first dataframe and therefore ignore all the days at the end of the year with no stockprices. Once I found the last valid prices for both stocks in the first dataframe for each year, I want to take the timestamp of these prices (index of the dataframe) and return the prices of the stocks in the second dataframe on these days. Pls note that stock 1 can have its last available price date on December 29th and stock 2 on December 30th for example. In the end I want to calculate the relative price difference between stock 1 in the first dataframe and stock 1 in the second dataframe on the last day of each year and the difference between stock 2 in the first dataframe and stock 2 in the second dataframe. The result should be a dataframe with the different years (e.g. 2016, 2017, 2018...) as columns and with two rows containing the relative price differences between the two stocks compared.

I want to create an app that users buy a ""shot"" of 1 artist so in the camera they pose themselves with a fixed image of the artist.  

something like a filter but a fixed image of an artist appears on the screen. the users can take various pics to test and when they select the one they want then, the order is completed. for example if they buy 4 ""shots"". they end with 4 pictures with their artist in their phone. 

 is this even possible? 

lets say we have 10 artist and each artist have 4 ""poses"". user buy 1 ""shot"" for 1 artist select the pose, take some pics. and then select the one and then the ""shot"" is used. 

it can have a watermark on top so if they take an screenshot the pictures will appear ""watermarked""

0,Lafftar,1596423848,i2pgh4,5,1,"Hi guys, i'm having issues with threading. I'm trying to test if variations of a website exist, I expected threading to greatly improve performance, but that really doesn't seem to be the case. 

Here's my threading code, 10 threads, if it works, i'd like to scale it to 1,000. Maybe 3,000:

    import threading
    from http.client import HTTPConnection
    from queue import Queue
    from time import time
    
    
    def ping(urls):
        for url in urls:

                h1 = HTTPConnection(url, 80, timeout=0.4)
                h1.request(""HEAD"", ""/"")
                h2 = h1.getresponse()
                return url, h2.status
            except:
                pass
    
    
    t1 = time()
    threads = []
    base_urls = [f""www.example{variation}.com"" for variation in range(0, 1000)]
    urls = [
        base_urls[0:100],
        base_urls[100:200],
        base_urls[200:300],

        base_urls[400:500],
        base_urls[500:600],
        base_urls[600:700],
        base_urls[700:800],
        base_urls[800:900],
        base_urls[900:1000],
    ]
    que = Queue()
    
    # create threads
    for url in urls:
        threads.append(threading.Thread(target=lambda q, arg1: q.put(ping(arg1)), args=(que, url)))
        # threads.append(threading.Thread(target=ping, args=(url,)))
    
    # start threads
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    
    # join threads (let main thread wait until all other threads ended)
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    while not que.empty():
        result = que.get()
        if result is not None:
            print(result)
    

And here's the synchronous code:

    
    from http.client import HTTPConnection
    from queue import Queue
    from time import time
    
    
    def ping(url):
        try:
            h1 = HTTPConnection(url, 80, timeout=0.4)
            h1.request(""HEAD"", ""/"")
            h2 = h1.getresponse()
            return url, h2.status
        except:
            pass
    
    
    t1 = time()
    print(""Started"")
    urls = [f""www.example{variation}.com"" for variation in range(0, 1000)]
    found = []
    for url in urls:
        found.append(ping(url))
    print(""finished!"")
    t2 = time()
    print(t2 - t1)
    print(found)

Results:

    thread - 83s - 5 results.

1,Buzzlers,1596424212,i2pjnt,0,1,"Hi, I've found a discrepancy between ST and my system when it comes to using python3. 

I recently switched from Linux mint 20 to Pop OS 20. I was working on pygame projects which worked fine in Mint. Now I can't get ST to find the pygame modules in Pop (likely because of the output listed below). 

Note: Pygame works fine when I run a program from the command line.

&amp;#x200B;

Typing;

import sys

print(sys.version)

While using python3 build in ST outputs 3.7.4, but in bash it outputs 3.8.2

Typing 'which python3' in bash outputs '/usr/bin/python3' (which links to the executable program python3.8). There are NO other python executables on my system that I can find. 

My ST build goes like this (this worked with no issues in Mint);

{ 

""cmd"": \[""python3"", ""-u"", ""$file""\],

}

and I've tried (among other slight variations);

{ 

""cmd"": \[""/usr/bin/python3"", ""-u"", ""$file""\], 

""file\_regex"": ""\^\[ \]File \\""(...?)\\"", line (\[0-9\]\*)"", 

""selector"": ""source.python"" 

}

both result in ST using python 3.7.4.

If I put the full path to the python executable (/usr/bin/python3) is still runs 3.7.4. 

But if I put the full path to the python3.8 executable (/usr/bin/python3.8) I get '\[Errno 2\] No such file or directory: '/usr/bin/python3.8''

I took a java class years ago in hs (almost failed), and did an Intro to Programming in college (python) (still in college) a couple years ago (the Intro to Programming course was basically equivalent up to like chapter 3 in ATBS). However, I guess there are probably other factors at play besides the authorship of the book resulting in my difficult comprehension. I probably spend on average 3 hours at most a week doing programming (only on my days off from work usually).

I started to notice more difficulty especially getting to around chapter 4. Once I got two part 2 in the book now I feel like I am just reading words at this point. I didnt really either start copying down the IDLE examples until the chapter im on now (chapter 9) because I thought it would redundant to do that when the results from the IDLE examples were shown in the book, but after doing the IDLE exercises for some reason I feel a little better.

Once I got to chapter 5 or 6, I havent been able to do any of the practice projects on my own. My mind pretty much goes blank, even reading again doesn't help much. It is like I don't even know how to approach the problem and can't even imagine a solution I guess? I just copy from stackoverflow, read peoples' explanations, and read the code itself to see if I can understand it. 

For me, I feel like reading about the concepts hasn't done much for me. I have noticed the same exact thing in my math classes in college: reading about the concepts usually just leaves me plain confused, while looking at examples/copying them, then practicing problems helps me out more.

I want to build and publish a python app that uses Selenium.

My problem is, that depending on which drivers/ search engines is used, my code has to adapt. I can come up with some semi-solutions but wanted to know if there is an official/ cleaner way of handling this? I'm not sure if a config file would help here. If there is no better way I will simply have to adapt my code for Chrome/ FireFox and maybe Safari.

Hope to get some good answers!

Because it's a long list, I'd like to have it just as an addition, sort of like can be done with text. At the end, I want to use a short number of highly complex patterns that will allow me the flexibility and future proofing that I need.

81,Lafftar,1596481208,i335cb,12,1,"Hi guys, i'm having a lot of trouble understanding asynchronicity.

I first tested out the basics with a simple function that slept for 2 seconds, then had it run in parallel among multiple threads, these were my results:

    1,000 max workers/input = 2.17s
    10,000 max workers/input = 4.03s
    100,000 max workers/input = 13s
    1,000,000 max workers/input = 425s

Code: 

    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    from time import sleep,time
    
    
    def printer(name):
        sleep(2)
        return ""Hello"", name
    
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100000) as executor:
        t1 = time()
        names = [f""Leggo{x}"" for x in range(0, 100000)]
        print(len(names))
        for i in executor.map(printer, names, timeout=30):
            print(i)
        # print(f3)
        t2 = time()
        print(t2-t1)

 I was beyond excited, if I can run 1,000,000 threads in parallel, work that would normally take 23 days can now take 5 minutes.

  
 So I tried it with a website variation tester i've been trying to build:

    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    from time import time
    from http.client import HTTPConnection
    
    
    def ping(url):
        try:
            h1 = HTTPConnection(url, 80, timeout=0.4)
            h1.request(""HEAD"", ""/"")
            h2 = h1.getresponse()
            return url, h2.status
        except Exception as error:
            return None
    
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        t1 = time()
        urls = [f""www.example{variation}.com"" for variation in range(0, 10)]
        print(len(urls))
        for i in executor.map(ping, urls, timeout=1000):
            if i is not None:
                print(i)
        t2 = time()
        print(t2-t1)

And results don't scale at all like i'd expect.

 I know there will be extra overhead because of the bigger functions i'm importing and all, but still, each thread should timeout by 0.5 seconds.

I have a text file of pairs, where each new line is a new pair and each of the two items in the pair are separated by a tab. ex:

    A10    H13
    B29    C12
    K29    S9
    H13    A10
    J28    P17
    C12    B29

All of the pairs are reciprocal duplicates (ex. X - Y, and Y - X). I would like to remove one of the two (doesn't matter which), and it would be even better if the code would still work when some but not all of the pairs have reciprocal duplicates.

So far, I have been able to accomplish the task using lists:

    fin = open('pairs.txt', 'r')
    
    pairs = []
    
    for line in fin:
        line_stripped = line.strip()

    print(pairs_no_doubles)

   * The function should print out the current numbers that are being added, and print their partial sum.
   * The function should keep track of how many partial sums there are.
   * The function should then print out how many partial sums there were.

Hello, everyone! I've been having a rough time with this coding. I'm trying to teach Python to ask for two values and either add, subtract, multiply, divide or calculate the average (although this part is only asking for the first four. Everything else has been #'ed out).

The issue I'm facing here is after some tinkering, I'm not sure why the output is just a blinking cursor with no errors. I taught it what the performCalculation is, what the Operation is and then taught it to do it now asking for input from the user, but nothing's happening.

Help, please. :)

I've recently been writing more programs, and thus adding more to my github. Some are full-length legit programs, others are just short scripts and dabbling with different ideas and mini-projects. 

I know however Github is your coding repository, it is the accumulation of your coding work, and is what employers will see/look at if they want to get an idea of your skill/expertise. As a result, should you only have finished/nice looking projects on there? I know you can set your repository to private, others to public. By default I have everything on public because some of my programs are public/hosted on servers so I want others to access/see the code, and also so I can get general feedback on my scripts as well.

The only thing that wasn't read back in the text were the two squirrelly   brackets.

    from gtts import gTTS
    import os
    mytext =  input(""Enter a phrase: "") language = ""en"" 
    myobj = gTTS(text=mytext, lang= language, slow=False)
    myobj.save(""four_score.mp3"") os.system('four_score.mp3') 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, i commented out a line to try and split the list, as found in a few different threads on line for the error, but it's not working. Still produces the same error. I also tried to pull the first result via its index but that returned the same result.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I go about making the least to it can be inserted into the obj file for the text to speech?

I've been trying to put together something very simple in the hopes of achieving a design, that would allow me to create instances of classes that, when an attribute changes, notify their observers but also would allow the attributes themselves to act on changes in the `__set__` method. I figured with descriptors this should be possible, but unfortunately it seems this amazing concept only works properly for class variables, not instance ones. So I applied a couple hacks leading to this:

    from typing import Any, List, Callable

        def __delete__(self, instance: Any):
            del self.value
    
        def __set_name__(self, owner: Any, name: str):

        def on_update(self, func: Callable[..., None], *args):

            except AttributeError:

    foo.on_update(
        lambda x: print(

        foo.age)
    foo.name.on_update(lambda x, y: print(""New value:"", x))
    foo.name = ""Bar""
    foo.age = 12

The issue now is, though, that because I'm trying to access `name` to retrieve the actual observable in `ReactiveOwner.on_update` it seems `__set_name__` in the property is never being called probably because of the limitations of descriptors with instances.

I've had Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy installed previously, however I deleted the folder and decided to stop learning Python.

Now I'm trying to get back into it and after installing the modules through VSCode, I'm unable to import them.

I have tried installing pandas with `pip3 install pandas` and the output I get is the following:

That appears like it's already installed?

When I try to import the module I get an error which makes me think the installation didn't go correctly?

82,findthereal,1593860466,hl1jv5,2,1,"Hey,

I've been working on a mini project as a learning exercise and I'm a bit stuck.
My partner plays a crafting game called 'Cat Game', she wants to be able to input the items and quantities she wants to craft, and in return be presented with instructions for crafting them.

All the crafted items boil down to some base items I've called resources:

    resources = ['Cotton','Log','Rock','Quartz','Premium Shards']            
    
    items = ['String','Wood','Ribbon','Metal','Needles','Sparkles','Bronze','Silver','Gold','Amethyst','Pendant','Necklace','Orb','Water','Fire','Waterstone','Firestone','Elementstone','Artifact','PremiumKey']


Using this wiki as a guide, I wrote a script to help me input the 'recipes' into a dictionary, the dictionary is as below 'recipe'. Note that items reference each other, it doesn't solve how to build each item end to end.
https://cat-game-the-cat-collector.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials

    recipe = {'String': {'Cotton': 3}, 'Wood': {'Log': 3}, 'Ribbon': {'String': 2,'Wood': 2},'Metal':{'Rock':3}, 'Needles': {'Metal': 4, 'Ribbon': 1}, 'Sparkles': {'Needles': 2, 'Ribbon': 2}, 'Bronze': {'Rock': 4}, 'Silver': {'Bronze': 3, 'Sparkles': 1}, 'Gold': {'Silver': 2, 'Sparkles': 2}, 'Amethyst': {'Quartz': 10}, 'Pendant': {'Amethyst': 7, 'Silver': 2}, 'Necklace': {'Pendant': 3, 'Gold': 2}, 'Orb': {'Quartz': 20}, 'Water': {'Orb': 2, 'Silver': 1}, 'Fire': {'Orb': 6, 'Gold': 1}, 'Waterstone': {'Water': 2, 'Ribbon': 10}, 'Firestone': {'Fire': 1, 'Sparkles': 2}, 'Elementstone': {'Firestone': 1, 'Waterstone': 1}, 'Artifact': {'Elementstone': 1, 'Necklace': 1}, 'PremiumKey': {'Premium Shards': 30}}

I successfully created a script that would iterate through and get down to resource level and print the resources in the right quantities. But that didn't actually give my client what she needed!

I've got a few gaps in my understanding that's putting a stop on things at the moment.

1. How do you dynamically build a nested dictionary and know what level you're at? Is it possible to store your position in a dictionary (like a path).
2. Similar to the above, how do you know the depth you're at in a dictionary so you could for example set indentation using justification?

I don't really want a direct solution to this stuff, I'd love to figure it out. So if you could point me in the right direction, that'd be so helpful!

Here's what I have at present, the print statement within the looper function is just a last minute hack to show the crafting process - I kind of need to do that with indentation so it's comprehensible.

# Problem Description

The [file bin/rule_cli.py](https://github.com/metaperl/import-hell-with-anaconda-python/blob/master/bin/rule_cli.py) adds `../src` to the PYTHONPATH and then
attempts to import `rule.myrule`.

# This works fine initially

If you were to clone [this source code repo](https://github.com/metaperl/import-hell-with-anaconda-python) and then execute the
following:

    shell&gt; python bin/rule_cli.py

You would see that `rule.myrule` loaded successfully.

## But then if you install rule from pypi it fails

If you then install rule from PyPi:

    shell&gt; pip install rule

### Now the same invocation fails:

shows a failed execution with the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No
module named 'rule.myrule'`

# So my question is:

If the `PYTHONPATH` clearly has the `src` directory of the local repo
first on the `PYTHONPATH` then how can `import rule.myrule` fail?

## My next question is:

What can I do so that `import rule.myrule` works when `rule` from PyPI

85,anonymouslycognizant,1593862080,hl1um8,4,1,"My goal: I'm making a simple calculator to practice using Guietta! and I'm at the point where I want to start writing the function for addition. My idea was to enter the first number then once the + button is pressed it saves the number and clears the input field then once another number is entered and the enter key is pressed the computation happens.

The Problem: Every way that I found to wait for a keypress pauses the whole program until a key is pressed which then means I can't interact with the gui.

The Solution: I need just the function to wait for the keypress but let the rest of the program continue running. I tried using msvcrt.kbhit() but I just couldn't get it working. 

I don't have any code to post because I tried a few different solutions but nothing was successful and I honestly don't know how close I was.  I don't necessarily need any help regarding the overall completion of the project.

I'm just finished chapter 3 and my question is... after a decent amount of effort, is it okay to check the answers and look up other peoples inputs? 

I feel stupid honestly. An example, was the collatz sequence project. I was sat there for 2 hours last night. Now, I could get the sequence to run but... if 56 was entered then it would go 169 - then back to 56 and then the program would just hang. As I tried to make more changes it just go worse with errors and  I blindly trying things

So I looked up other peoples efforts... To be fair, I did go through the code and the flow of it. certain aspects clicked for me - Reading peoples suggestions about not putting while loops in your functions, the layouts between different answers , breaking out of infinite loops and with continue and break. 

But I feel like I'm not going to benefit from that habit? Yea now I can type out the collatz sequence from memory, but I didn't work that out myself. 

Then this morning,  jumped on HackerRank to check it out and the If-Else problem, literally had me so confused... 3 and a half hours, I tried my hardest. I had everything green except the 6th condition. So again, I turned to google and I was miles off. Really mad at myself when I saw the answer because it used the % operator, which I used in the collatz sequence just last night.

I understand I'm completely new, my questions really are, if I can't do a problem, am I better off just moving on and trying to digest the information? Returning as things improve on my end? Re-reading chapters? Is there things I can do to help me get better at working the problems out? Any advice would be appreciated really. Thanks if you read this.

Since then my project has grown in both complexity and headache-inducing-ness. Probably because I'm a Python noob. Anyways, here's a list of stuff I'd like to do with/add to this program:

* pyaudio

* gTTS (Google Text To Speech)
* User input for adding/removing array items, so the user can specify what to add/remove
* Speech Recognition
* Multiple Python files because organization

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the errors I've been hitting so far:

* I can't add or remove JSON array items from a function in a for loop (modify function in the code).
* I can't grab a list from an array based on a list (show function in the code).
* I can't end the program by typing ""end"". I know I have to break out of the while loop to do this, just not sure why.

I'll add errors as I hit them.

 I then switched to SQLite3 and it is an improvement. In SQLite3 I am storing data like this:

    state1 | move1 | score
    state1 | move2 | score
    ...
    state2 | move1 | score
    ...

SQLite3 is an improvement but is still slower than I want.

42,Cojonimo,1591201233,gvwz6v,18,1,"Hi, I would like to use django in a virtual environment and have a problem doing that.  

I create my virtual environment with:  
     `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 env`  

Then I activate it with:  
     `source env/bin/activate`  

The first issue that seems strange is that the command 'pip freeze' does not give an empty result, but instead lists the packages that are system wide installed.  
In *pyvenv.cfg* there is an entry 'include-system-site-packages = false'. Has anbody an idea why system-site packages are still listed by *pip freeze*?

And the other thing is , when I try to start django with  
    `python manage.py runserver`  
then it works just fine. But when I try to do the same thing in the created virtual environment it does not start and says:  

    `` Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""manage.py"", line 10, in main
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'
    
    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
    
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""manage.py"", line 21, in &lt;module&gt;
        main()
      File ""manage.py"", line 12, in main
        raise ImportError(
    ImportError: Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?``


So something seems wrong with my virtual environments. Has anybody an idea what is the issue? I don't really have much experience with python. I use arch linux btw. :)  

*edit: And another thing that I forgot to mention is, when I try to install django with the virtual environment activated it says:  

    $ pip install django
    Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable

I'm certain I got this working on a work computer, but now I'm on my personal one, it's not behaving. I did rewrite from memory, so I could have made a mistake.

The random.shuffle works, and the for loop will stop once the count gets to 3. However, it just repeats itself instead of going through the list, so it may select Q4, and run through that 3 times, then stop.

If I get rid of the while loop, it runs through correctly, but obviously goes through the whole Questions list, when I want it to stop at a certain point.

The .csv file is read in line-by-line, and when it detects that it's gotten to the end of a chunk of data, it plots the data.

The figure that I'm trying to recreate the [basic behaviour of is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ch4y8aym4pugfj0/Screenshot%202020-06-01%2012.55.32.png?dl=0) \- but when I run this code, [I get this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zyjoc0ow2d14up3/Screenshot%202020-06-03%2011.35.50.png?dl=0). Its like pyplot is adding a new axis with each call - which can be seen by the yticks (and I guess the xticks if you could see them).

I've uploaded a MnWE (minimum not working example) to GitHub along with the .csv file: [https://github.com/aeronauty/N16Databank/blob/master/FunnyPlottingBehaviour.ipynb](https://github.com/aeronauty/N16Databank/blob/master/FunnyPlottingBehaviour.ipynb)

You can see in the file that I've added a logical called `Innerplotting` that changes whether the plots are made in the loop or in a single call out of the loop (the one out of the loop only adds two plots). I wanted to see if it was a problem with the way that I call pyplot multiple times in a loop (though I've done this before with no issue).

I've given this code to a few of my students who have shown the same error - and none of them have figured it out yet. I'd rather get this script to work as it automates what would be a lot of copying and pasting otherwise.

I'm guessing it's something to do with the way the lists `CL` and `alfa` are constructed, but I'd like to know *why* so I can use methods like this in the future.

Here is the problem though: When the player moves, the player just duplicates like this in the output:

We've been using repl.it and I wanted to make a sort of 'weather app simulator'. My plan was that the computer asks something like 'do you want to know the weather of Thursday or Friday' and if they answer Thursday it shows the weather for Thursday and if they say Friday it would show the weather of Friday.

1. Is it possible to make a virtual environment on a flash drive? If it is, how would I go about doing that? Do I create it the same way I do on a normal drive or do I need to take some extra steps?
2. Answer to this question is probably no but I will ask anyway: is there any way to write a location on a flash drive into system's path to run scripts from a flash drive easily or would it break upon taking the flash drive out of the pc? Do I completely misunderstand the interaction of path with python? (I haven't been able to make the path thing work at all: I just run the scripts from the folder they are in through the explorer)
3. Is it a good idea to install independent python and IDE to a flash drive to run both from any computer? What would be the easiest way to install python on a flash drive?

Also a question unrelated to flash drives: is it good to have one virtual environment for all of the little projects to be in?

I'm running into an issue with the following piece of code:

    category = path.split(""/"")[3]
    label = int(category.split(""_"")[0][1]) 
    y.append(label)

The error is as follows:  **IndexError: list index out of range.** The error comes on the first line, when I do the split. I (think) I understand what the error is implying, but when I do len(path) I get 33 ... so \[3\] shouldn't give a problem. 

I tested this following snippet of code to understand split better: 

    txt = ""welcome to the jungle""
    x = txt.split()[2]
    print(x)

For the code above, the output is ""the"" as expected as it's the \[2\] entry. 

Now, back to my code, when I run:

    x = path.split()
    print(x)

I get the following output:

10,CarefulAstronaut,1588572276,gd62tf,2,1,"Hi All,

Since I have lots of time with quarantine I decided to challenge myself to do a 5 week python practice, focusing on specific libraries or aspects of python that I need to practice or want to learn more about.  I am posting the outputs and code mostly for accountability, but would happily take any feedback as well.

This week was all about visuals from Matplotlib.  I had followed a lot of tutorials before, but I wanted to dig a bit deeper on the capabilities found within the library. I found a dataset of Pokemon from the first 6 generations on kaggle (linked below) and set to work.

They're pretty basic graphs (bar and pie) but I was really happy with the radar plot at the bottom.  Fully stole the code from the Matplotlib site on how to build a radar plot, but I will definitely look deeper into what that module does.  Am mostly pleased with it because I had an idea of how I wanted to present the data and was thrilled to see it come together in the end. 

Things I learned this week, and thoughts for the future:

1. There are multiple ways and syntax for the same thing in Matplotlib (and other libraries). I think the way forward for learning libraries would be to use the most up-to-date syntax and avoid features that will be deprecated in the future. Need to be careful to not copy-paste from StackOverflow all the time and actually read through the guides
2. It is possible to house a list of lists of numbers (Pokemon\_Exploration.py;line 125).  I followed the example to get to this point, but what are the possibilities with this style of housing? Is it just for simplicity to house a subset of data within a single variable?
3. I need to continue practicing loops/methods to eliminate duplicate code.  There are 50 lines of code for Fig. 3 and I'm confident it could be much shorter.

Next week the adventure continues with the pandas library! I recently saw a post here about 'Minimally Sufficient Pandas' and I am not up to snuff.

20,p479h,1588582066,gd7xxl,10,1,"Hey, I am relatively new at programming but after a bit of experimentation I found some interesting shortcuts that let you do relatively complex things in one line. For example, we can use one line conditionals for rather complex situations like the following: 

let's say we have the variable, i, and depending on its value, we will set a different value for a second variable, k:

    k=0 if i==2 or i==2 else k=1 if i==3 or i==7 else None

I also found out you can call functions using this method. For example, let's say we want to set the titles of many axes depending on a conditional:

    ax.set(title=""True"") if i==0 else ax.set(title=""False"") if i==1 else ax.set(title=""IDK"") if i&gt;1 else None

Again, after some experimentation I realized the same can be done for list comprehensions:

    [print(x) for x in range(10)] will actually print x 10 times and then return a list full of whatever that function returns.

Do you know any more unconventional ways of executing functions and defining variables that are not conventional? I know it's bad practice to use such methods. I am only asking this because I am curious about the possibilities.

However, there's another component of the program that will be storing a different set of data. The data will have column headers and integer values associated with those column headers. The difficulty is the column headers will change over time.

* s2 = ""am happy""
* s3 = ""feel sad""
* the output should be: ""I feel really sad""

Hi everyone i am back for an update and hopefully to give some motivation back to the community that helped me so much in the last 6 months.

i started programming back in November and until today i managed to study and code for 350 hours. you can see my 0-150 hour post here

[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/e8uo6c/my\_first\_100\_hour\_of\_learning\_programming28\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/e8uo6c/my_first_100_hour_of_learning_programming28_days/) 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/f2cveb/my\_first\_150\_hours\_of\_programming\_and\_my\_flask/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/f2cveb/my_first_150_hours_of_programming_and_my_flask/) 

the last two months are very hard for anyone but i took this opportunity of social isolation and not working to study even harder than before, for a total of 200 more hours in 2 months.Of course the real number of hours is higher cause I don’t count the time I spended thinking about a problem before sleep or searching stuff as I was waiting the bus!

in my last post i was at the point were i had made a simple flask webapp to log my running activities but it was far from functional. No multi-user functionality and million of other problems. So here we go

&amp;#x200B;

* Learned about flask sessions in order to create      user authentication. i followed allong corey's schafers youtube video      series to learn how to implement that to my app
* then i studied a little bootstrap in order to add      some help modals for the user
* i found the first flask limitation. flask is not      great for interactivity of users with the page without reloading the page.      i tried very hard to work around it but soon i realized that sooner or      later i have to learn javascript. I started learning some basic javascript      syntax (vary basic) and i created a simple 5 lines script for one of my      web apps pages
* I realized that learning javasript is something      that I cant avoid forever so i left my project on the side and started      learning some javasript. Fortunately it was easier than i thought to learn      the basics. Knowing      one language already made learning a second one easier
* i created some simple javascript scripts and i      wanted to start a new project. I learned about apis and fetch and i tried      to make a simple javascript weather app. Deep down i had no interest in      this project so i never finished it but i gain some experience in the      process
* i learned about DOM and DOM manipulation using      javascript, now things started to get a little clearer
* in javascript you basically use the browser      console as a prompt so i started visiting random websites opening the mark      up on the side and started typing console commands to select and alter web      elements.
* Went back to bootstrap and learned the proper way      of creating a layout and not just spamming and copy pasting code on the      screen until something happens. If you visit my fitnessbot repository in      github you will understand what i am talking about
* Back to javascript , learned more about fetching      apis and more about apis in general,found a nutrition api online and      practiced making some calls to it. Then i created a simple bootstrap      layout for it. Basically i made a simple app where a user can search      different foods and the app returns the calories protein carbs and fat      values back
* Back to Flask. Studied about different website      architectures like monolithic approach REST apis. Took me very long to      understand and frankly i dont thing i get it now either completely!!
* I watched some tutorials about flask REST apis      and i created a backend CRUD app for my nutrition app
* found Postman a great software with which you can      make calls to an api to test. It helps a lot in the creation of an api 
* Connected front and backend. Basically now i had      an app with javascript on the front end and flask on the back end. The two      parts are not connected they just send JSON files to each other with      information.
* The biggest problem with this aproach was the      user authentication. In flask i used sessions back this didnt seem to work      now. i learn about token authentication and jwt library in python and used      this to authenticate users. 
* The next problem was cross site origin requests      (CORS). Basically my front end backend were a different      ""website"" and chrome blocked the communication between those two      for safety reasons. I solved this issue using flask-cors library. This is      were i had my worst bug in my time programming. it took me almost 3 days      working on a simple bug not knowing what to do or search. Basicaly i      forgot to pass a variable to a javascript function but console instead of      telling me that it loged a random error about cross origin requests. 3      days i tried to fixed something that it wasnt broken.
* created some simple graphs with chartjs and the      project was finished

i have a bachelors degree in a different field and i was planning to go for a masters degree next autumn. i really had no passion for my field so i took a big desicion. To chase a master's in computer science. i soon realized that most of the programs in my country are not easy to accepted especialy if you dont have a cs degree, i did some reasearch and i promised to myself that i will do my best to be ready until june that the apllication will start and the intereviews will take place

&amp;#x200B;

* i started IBM's machine learning with python      course on edx and studied more about the math behind the field. I have a      good math background so it was not that hard to [follow.](https://follow.it/) it took me 2 weeks to finish the program
* i started Harvards cs50 course. Great course. It      kicked my ass was very time consuming had some very hard projects but in      the end i managed to finish it. Learned some basics in C, data structures,      algorithms, big O notations, efficiency, computer memory and other stuff.      it took me 2 weeks to finish this 11 week program. It took me basically 50-60      hours
* i started a udemy front end course and finished      it in 1 week. Learned more about html, css, css grid
* i started practicing css grid and made a single      page website
* Back to javascript. Studied ES6 oop prototypes      classes and tried to figure out proper ways to right javascript apps. My      nutrition app was a mess, a huge spaghetti code full of backs. I watch      many tutorials from Traversy media and other channels.
* Started a new simple app this time with pure html      css and js no bootstrap and tried to write better js code
* failed at the second part!
* created another rest api with flask for practice      this time for this new app
* At this point i had two functional web apps and i      decided to deploy them
* Worked on making my web apps responsive to      mobiles 
* tried to make a simple google chrome extention      for my app with mixed results
* created a custom personal website with bootstrap      for practice and also to show my portfolio and deployed it on github pages
* back to python. i took some time to learn the      basics of opencv library, i will try to make something cool in the future!
* Went back to my first fitness app. i tried to      make some changes back the code was a mess. i really started liking js and      i dont like anymore the limitations of a full flask app. So i decided to      write it from the begining with seperated front end back end
* i found online a cool dashboard layout base and      decided to use this. Make ome serious changes to the template and made my      biggest end best app in less than 2 days. In this moment i became pretty      good at flask apis js and simple web app creation, so even though i had to      rewrote all my python code to js i didnt faced serious walls!
* i tried to solve some leetcode problems, and i      realized that even though i was good at codewars puzzles my methods were      actually like ""brute"" forcing my way to a solution. I realized      that i had to learn some theory on data structures and algorithms before      trying again.

right now i am studing data structures and algorithms ( binary search,linked lists,trees and things like that) in order to get some good base knowledge. I  have less that one month before applying for a cs master, so pretty much i am done for the season. I will do my best in this time i have and hopefully my passion, my fast learning skills and my projects will be enough to get accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the format, this is a lightly edited edition of my notes. i really like keeping notes as it  keeps me motivated, i can see my progress and also give something back to the community. Also i am thinking of creating a simple blog for practice and post there my journey and tips for people that are starting now.

I also created this personal website for fun and posted my portfolio there. You can find my apps and code in the portfolio area.

&amp;#x200B;

My project is (I think?) fairly simple. I'm trying to a language analysis about sarcasm for my Master's thesis, and to do that I want to collect examples of comments containing the ""/s"" sarcasm marker. This is the code I've been using, which I copied from another post (sorry, I will try and find the author later to credit them):

&amp;#x200B;

    my_keywords = [""/s""]
    
    for comment in reddit.subreddit(""all"").stream.comments():
        cbody = comment.body
        if any(keyword in cbody for keyword in my_keywords):
            print(comment)

&amp;#x200B;

Doing this resulted in me getting the comment IDs which was a start, but when I changed the last line to:

    print(comment.body)

I realised I was getting quite a lot of bot/auto moderator replies, which I didn't want, as well as comments which people saying something like ""happy/sad"".

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are these:

1. I don't know the syntax or what I should write to make exceptions. I'm sure this is a really easy thing, but when I tried adding something like *my\_badwords = \[""bots""\]* and *and* or *elseif*, I was just always getting syntax errors. Could you suggest something to add here or direct me towards the resources I need because I haven't been able to find it yet.
2. Is there a way for me to only search for isolated ""/s"" and not when people are giving two options? If I leave a space on either side like:

&amp;#8203;

    my_keywords = ["" /s ""]

would that make any difference?

63,robifis,1588607297,gddzra,1,1,"Hi all,

Long time lurker and first time poster, after deciding to start learning to code (again). 

I had initially started with the 100 day coding challenge,  trying to learn JavaScript. That was back in May/June. 
I really enjoyed the learning process in the beginning and I was making some decent progress. I ended up giving up though as I felt like I was getting overwhelmed with the amount of stuff that’s out there (Node/React etc). I was coding less and less before I eventually stopped all together around September. 

Onto Python. One of the “excuses” for me giving up JS was that I wasn’t very good at UI design. I’ve always enjoyed creating the logic of an app and I find it really satisfying when the code works. 

I’ve been studying python intensely, doing countless courses on Udemy and following along with Tutorials on YouTube. 

With all that said, I am starting to feel similar to when I was learning JS. The thing is, I feel like a “fraud” if I don’t code because I feel like I am wasting time, especially during Lockdown. The reason I am trying to learn to code is because I am actually after a career change(soon). 

How does everyone here find the motivation and drive to keep going? Am I putting too much pressure on myself? Am I putting that much effort into it all that I am slowly burning out?

65,think50,1588607952,gde726,5,1,"Greetings [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython)!

I've seen a couple other success stories in here recently and thought I'd chime in with my own experience to hopefully inspire someone. Over the past few months, I’ve been working on an order forecasting tool to save time and avoid mistakes on a task that is a regular part of my job. Over the last month, I've taken advantage of the extra time on my hands due to COVID-19 and rolled the system out to the rest of my company’s sales team.

I'm not new to general nerdy-ness, having built websites since I was 10 in around 1996 - getting my first paid gig at age 11 to create a catalog website for my mom's school furniture drop-shipping dealership. It was the epitome of bad design and architecture, but let's not get into that! I spent a lot of my adolescence playing with computers, and made some cash throughout college by picking up simple web development projects.

That said, Python was brand new to me as of December 2019 when I started this project.

I'm in sales, dealing with a ""fast-moving consumer good"" product, and the 30-person sales team I'm a part of manages about 100 wholesalers throughout the Eastern US. We sell a pretty broad portfolio of products, but our core lineup is about 20 items.

One area where ***money is left on the table*** regularly is through out-of-stocks and out-of-codes (product expiration).

* If a wholesaler orders too little, we miss sales at retail which over time will damage our retailer relationships.
* If a wholesaler orders too much, product goes out of code in the warehouse and everyone suffers - we generally co-op the cost of destroyed product, although a bad taste is left in the wholesaler's mouth no matter what.
* **The solution that sticks out is to use a data driven approach and manage inventory in a way that closely tracks actual sales rates.**

Previously, our sales team's relationships with wholesaler forecasters were spotty and inconsistent. Everyone had their own way of handling this, and some simply relied on wholesalers to get the job done on their own. I regret to say that the latter strategy does not tend to be successful.

My personal method was to pull the relevant reports and manually merge the data to create an Excel spreadsheet to calculate **Days (of inventory) on Hand** on a rolling basis throughout the ordering period. I would use the resultant data to determine whether wholesaler forecasts were suitable and make recommendations where I saw opportunities.

Data points needed for each wholesaler/item combo, which come from **three different source reports**:

1. Current Inventory
2. Current Rate of Sale
3. Days on Hand (calculated as Current Inventory / Current RoS)
4. Orders placed for the next eight weeks
5. Tickets submitted at the last minute to change the above orders

I manage 20 wholesalers myself, and this data entry component was a nightmare. It would take a full work day about once every month or two just to enter the data correctly into my spreadsheet, then I had to craft individual emails to summarize my suggestions based on the data. It was error prone and time-consuming. One day, I decided I had better things to do.

Since this is already a wall of text, I'll spare you the history of iterations of the program. Current setup:

* **Flask app** creates an attractive interface - currently working on polishing this to make sure the tool outlasts me...
* **Python program** \- takes three input reports, cleanses data, merges data to CSV output report
* **Excel formatting** \- just a little manual work on the final report to make it easier to look at and use. Want to automate this later, too...

Since my normal day-to-day has changed a lot since COVID-19, I've expanded the scope of the report to include our entire distribution footprint and was able to sell my management team on the program! I then took some time to polish up the program and make it ready for others to use. I created training materials and scheduled full sales team (30 people) introduction sessions as well as breakout trainings for each state as a team.

Our sales force is now operating in a consistent way and using my output report to perform this task weekly. This gives a much more granular view and allows us to be nimble in the market. Our production team is ecstatic because the report can also be used on their end to make purchasing and production decisions, and because we expect the number of last minute order changes (tickets) to reduce significantly over time.

Rolling this project out has been challenging and has taught me as much about project management and staff training/soft skills as it has about Python. I was given a small spot bonus for my efforts this past quarter, which helped to offset the poor execution of my other KPIs due to my inability to be in the market. Work on this project has been written into my bonus structure for Q2, as well, **so I guess that makes me a professional programmer now**.

The point of all of this is to suggest you **find somewhere in your existing organization where money is being left on the table and try to scrape it up!** I estimate that this new way of handling inventory management will save my company $50,000+ per year and countless hours of productivity by our sales team. I’m currently designing a SQLite database to analyze key metrics that I can use to convey the value of the project as time goes on and the benefits become clear.

I’ll be using this story as I shift my career in a new direction, so I thank anyone reading this for the opportunity to write it all out. I hope you take some inspiration from this and realize that a project that takes just a few months to spin up can go a long way toward making a big difference in your company and in your future.

I hope to follow up in a few months with a new title attached to my name.

Take care.

I've been spending quarantine time teaching myself Python and could use some help!  All of my previous data analysis experience is within Excel, so that's kind of how I've been approaching and thinking about things.

I believe where I'm stuck is with functions and/or loops.  I've written out all of my code and it works as it should when I manually run the file on a line by line basis, but I don't know how to get the codebase to ""just work"" autonomously.

For example, when I work in Excel I can write a function, double click, and then it will just apply the formula down the column until the end of the data table, but I'm not sure what the Python equivalent of that is.

Right now I'm working in a Google Sheet, hoping to apply some Python to it.  The sheet is for monitoring stock tickers and I want the Python script to run down the tickers I have listed in column A and then pull a piece of data I've already coded with BeautifulSoup (this info isn't available w/ the native Google Finance connector, fyi).

Essentially this is the excel formula I'm trying to make:

=IF(ISBLANK(A2), \[Stop the Script\], \[Insert BeautifulSoup Data\])

The reason I'm building it is due to an ongoing joke, where a friend has to beat a record of posting the same thing every day. But this goes on for months, so I need a way to just keep it going all the time.

I have no ideas, and not even sure if it's possible.

I created a firefox scraper to check if a product is eligible for purchase with a Health Savings Account (HSA).

Not my first scraper, but it is the biggest project I have worked on and the first one with classes, modules, cli arguments and using git/github.

Some included features

* Headless firefox
* Use argparse to take command line arguments
* Case sensitive and alphanumeric check on cli arguments
* Check if a product name include spaces
* Fuzzy search for similar products
   * Baby oil will return ""baby bottle"", ""baby formula""

Todo

* alphanumeric check breaks when accepting products with spaces
   * comment out for now
* improve search results by saving data into database instead of rescraping website.
   * Need to research databases
* accounts variable is repeated and need to find a way to not repeat that
* More tidy organization

I make a little counter class that take a function at instantiation. This function have the logic for understand if a set of dices is a scoring set of one kind. So i make one function for each of straight, full, poker and generala. 

This functions are really simple. Like: 


    def es_generala(tirada):
         return tirada[0] == 5
    
    def es_poker(tirada):
         return tirada[1] == 4

So I thought I had python3 and should upgrade to the latest 3.7.7 with \`brew upgrade python3\` which gave me \`Error: python3 not installed\`. Even though that didn't make sense I went ahead and installed it again with \`brew install python3\` then checked the version again and it said \`Python 3.6.4 :: Anaconda, Inc\`. again.

My current understanding is that a module's code is executed on import. The `if __name__ == '__main__'` construct, helps to guide against unwanted code from executing. I have two files `test.py` , and `test_two.py`. Let's say `test_two.py` currently looked like this:

    def intro():     
        print('This is the the intro function for test_two.')
    
       
    intro() 
    print('This is test_two.') 

While `test.py` looked like this:

    import test_two 
    print('This is test.') 

Without the `if __name__ == '__main__'` construct, all the code that is in `test_two.py` is going to be ran when [`test.py`](https://test.py) is executed. That's why [`test.py`](https://test.py) will end up looking like this when ran:

    This is the the intro function for test_two. 
    This is test_two. 
    This is test. 

This isn't the type of result I'd be looking for, I'd just looking to be able to import `test_two.py`, and use whatever I want from the module without any side effects. Now this is where the `if __name__ == '__main__`' construct comes into play.

What `test_two.py` looks like now is this:

    def intro():
        print('This is the the intro function for test_two.')   
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':     
        intro()     
        print('This is test_two.') 

Now, when I import `test_two.py`, and if I wanted to use any type of function etc from that module, I'd be able to do so without any of the previous side effects. That's why the result of running [`test.py`](https://test.py) would look like:

    This is test.

Hi! I’ve been learning python lately for about the past 6 months ( got the course a year ago but I’ve kinda been on/off ) and I just got through errors and exception handling as well as OOP. ( which If anyone could give me advice on when to organize my code that way I would really appreciate it ) I have an assigned milestone project which is to create blackjack. In the past, I’ve gone through a lot of languages, Java, Swift, Dart, etc. I don’t really like them because I can never find a use case for them. Python has finally been the language I’ve been looking for but I don’t know what to do with it. In my life I don’t have pretty much anything to automate, I don’t have enough knowledge to automate my homework and these assigned projects make me so frustrated because they seem so useless.

16,lastwizzle,1585950147,fuh5mc,0,1,"Hi All 

I'm looking for suggestions on how to improve the below process.

I have a table called **deductible\_table** that contains the mapping of the amount of insurance, deductible amount, and peril with its corresponding discount factor. This table is used as a reference where the known mapping is contained in order to perform the interpolation.

I am provided with **input\_table** where each **Group** represents a unique zipcode/AOI combination. The problem I am encountering is for the current State I am working on new logic was set in place. This logic states that the **Wind** Peril should have the same deductible amount as Hurricane.

However, Hurricane has logic set up that certain zip codes contain mandatory 3% Deductible amount on the Hurricane peril regardless of what they choose before. To account for this I created a new column called **Hurricane 3%**. It should be noted that the value of this column does not affect the **Wind** Deductible amount. For example, if originally the Hurricane deductible was set at 0.02, but got flagged at 3% this would have no effect on the **Wind** deductible amount.

The below code works for small data sets. However, it is quite cumbersome when I am dealing with larger data sets. I believe the issue is around my method for doing both the Wind, and Hurricane interpolation where as I am itterating one by one and applying those amount of insurance/ Deductible combinations.

I have this function and this function call:

        return first if not rest else first + mysum_three(rest)
    
    print(mysum_three(('s','p','a','m')))
    

Everything works but I'm not sure why I would need to use a double set of parenthesis when I call the function. If I don't I get a TypeError: mysum\_three() takes 1 positional argument but 4 were given. But once I give it the double set of parenthesis around the function call it works perfectly.

75,Bren1209,1585996889,furknn,11,1,"Hey everyone. Started the self-teaching thing November last year. Been following this sub for a few weeks now and today I'm making my first post because Google can't help me. 

I built a small program that fetches the Covid-19 stats for my country, adds the latest stats to a row in an Excel file, and displays it on a Tk GUI. With that I added a button that opens the stats history on a Matplotlib graph to see the (saddening) increase from a visual aspect. Proud to say this program only took me a few hours of quarantine and worked perfectly despite the filthy code. So I decided to turn it into an executable using Pyinstaller so I don't have to open an IDE to run it every time. However, creating the .exe would cause the main folder to be 650mb...

After some Googling I found out that it was because I was using Anaconda as my environment within Pycharm, and that Pyinstaller was bundling all the unused libraries associated with my program together. I tried changing the environment and changing settings in CMD to NOT have Conda as my base environment, but somehow every time I bundled the .exe it would still result to using Conda. Even using the `--exclude` option to exclude all the unused libraries didn't bring down the size by more than 250mb.

Eventually I came across a thread somewhere saying I should try uninstalling Anaconda, which I did because I barely use it anyway. And voila! My 650mb program has now gone down to 22mb. 

Here is the new issue...

The program worked fine when it was 650mb, but now it errors out. So I reopened the .py file in Pycharm and all the libraries are still installed, no imports are 'missing'. (Obviously I re-checked all the `pip install blahblah's` as well). When I run it from within Pycharm (using a Virtualenv Python 3.8), Tkinter errors out on almost every line. If I'm not mistaken, Tk should come pre-installed with Python? Because it doesn't allow me to install it in the interpreter settings.

Every time I comment out the line providing the error, it moves onto the next:

1. `_tkinter.TclError: image ""pyimage10"" doesn't exist (Line 208)`
2. `_tkinter.TclError: bad window path name "".!label"" (Line 216)`
3. `_tkinter.TclError: bad window path name "".!button"" (Line 219)`

When I run `tkinter._test()` everything works just fine. 

Needless to say I have not changed my code or the file structure since the program worked the first time. I've also tried creating a new venv and copying the code over to a new .py file, as well as the media resources. I've even gone as far as cutting the code out and retyping it exactly as is, and then again but with new image/label/button names.

``` 
Which is very odd because decorator is a standard library and is definitely installed.
```
pip freeze | grep decorator
decorator==4.0.11
``` 
Now I did a little digging and found someone who had a similar issue and it was due to having other python modules in the working directory (which again is odd because I was in the root user directory). 

So I had a look at the files in my root directory and there's all these hidden files including python modules there (including ipython)! What the hell have I done and how can I fix it?

85,Evaltian,1586001947,fusl7y,0,1,"Hello!

I was wondering if someone could share their knowledge with me, I've decided to take up coding with python, the last couple of days I've been doing a lot of reading and have hit a point where i'm stuck.

I'd like to make a program that reads from a virtual memory address and if the value is below what the specified amount is in the script the program will then press the ""F1"" button and repeat this until the value is satisfied, from what I can gather PyMem and PyautoGUI would do this for me, getting autoGUI to work is simple enough but i'm having a hard time understanding Pymem.. C++ looks like it would probably be better for what I need but i'd like to see it through with python.

The program in question doesn't have a ""Title"" it's just a bunch of numbers that change every few seconds, I'm guessing this is to throw off external programs.

could someone produce a source code that checks a memory address for a specific number and if the number is not true press F1 (loop)
so I can study it and understand how to put it all together?

I initially tried to define a function with numerous helper functions within it. Once I wrote that and started testing it, I realised defining functions within functions leads to messy scopes - I couldn't get the helper functions to modify the variables of the parent function in the way I wanted (or maybe I just didn't know how to).

I then managed to get it to work by just rewriting the parent function, but instead of using helper functions making everything within it explicit:

This is obviously a terrible solution. I had a look at others' solutions, but they seemed to be a bit too sophisticated for me to properly understand.

1. I'm scraping a lot of images from a lot of webpages. Sometimes scraping gets interrupted, due to internet drop and other reasons. When I restart scraping again. Scraping starts from the beginning. I use os.path.isfile(filename) to check if the file is already there and only download if it's not there. While this works. I still have to check for each file which takes some time. 

I looked up online and came to conclusion that when the interrupt occurs I can catch that as an exception and write the relevant url and filename and other info into a file, may be JSON and read it while starting scraping again. Are there any other approaches for this. Also, can I use sqlite for this instead of a JSON file.

2.Browsers, when the download is in progress, append .part and other extensions (crdownload is used by chrome) to the file and remove it when download has completed.

I'm trying to achieve the same, so that when I take a look at the images in my Downloads folder I can find the ones that were partially downloaded because of interruption.

My approach: Since I'm downloading images, all HTTP responses have a Content-Length header. Shall I compare the size of the downloaded image and Content-Length and remove the .part extension when they are same. I would like to know other approaches.

3. How can I get current download speed, I'm trying to calculate ETA, since I already know the size of the image from Content-Length header.

    G = nx.from_numpy_matrix(d_ij)
    
    labels = [""C0"",""C1"",""C2"",""C3"",""C4"",""C5"",""C6"",""C7"",""C8"",""C9""]

    plt.show()

How do I know that both give the wrong plots ? Well from the distance matrix the  distance between the 1st and 2nd point is 14.4496 (far from each other) and the distance between 10 and 8 is 5.4265 (close each other). The network plot however shows contradictory results. Any suggestion on how I could graph and label this properly ?

15,mw82,1583333666,fde3sy,4,1,"Hi all.  I am working through the MIT 6.0001 class.  I am working through problem set 2, and I want to make a function that starts with blanks for a secret word, then adds in letters as they are guessed.  I'm trying to trouble shoot my code.  So far I have the following:

&amp;#x200B;

       #guessed letters
       guessed=['c','i','h','k','e','n']
       def get_guessed_word(secret_word, letters_guessed):
           blank='_ ' * len(secret_word)
           print(blank)
           if True:
               for char1 in secret_word:
                   for letter in letters_guessed:
                       if char1==letter:
                           samePos=secret_word.index(char1)
                           samePos2=samePos*2
                           #concatenation of blanks and guessed letters
                           blank=blank[0:samePos2]+secret_word[samePos]+
                           blank[samePos2+1:]
                           print(blank) #used to troubleshoot
       get_guessed_word('chicken', guessed)
       #secret word is chicken

Output:

    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
    c _ _ _ _ _ _ 
    c h _ _ _ _ _ 
    c h i _ _ _ _ 
    c h i _ _ _ _ 
    c h i _ k _ _ 
    c h i _ k e _ 
    c h i _ k e n 

Why is the 'c' not printed twice in the output?  My interpretation of the code is that for each character in  secret\_word, the program will 'look' for a match in guessed and replace the blank with the letter.

I'm extremely new to Python and programming and I've been going through this book and its exercises the best way I can (I couldn't find solutions for the exercises online).
Exercise nº10 asks me to replace all instances of a substring and I've been stuck on this exercise for almost 2 hours (yes I know...).
This is the code I have so far:



def replace(s, old, new):
    if ' ' not in s:
        newstr = ''
        for ch in s:
            if ch != old:

            if ch == old:
                newstr = newstr + new

42,Knitcap_,1583347337,fdhjsj,1,1,"I often see people on this subreddit recommending people new to programming or Python to do the entirety of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. After going through the 2nd edition of the book myself with no prior programming knowledge I feel I am in a position to give my opinion on the book. TLDR: I believe most of it is good, but it's unnecessary to do the chapters about automating software you don't use.

I think the core idea of the book is great. It is the perfect combination of showing you what to do and having you do it for yourself. It's great for automating repetitive tasks you would often have in an office job. The first few chapters are an incredible introduction to the Python language and programming as a whole. That said, here's my thoughts on the content of the individual chapters: 

Chapters 0-6 absolutely necessary for people new to programming / python

Chapters 7-12 &amp; 17 very handy for automating everyday tasks and making future tasks easier to deal with, even if you don't have an office job.

The other chapters are highly situational in my opinion. Do them if you often use excel, pdf, JSON, etc. I believe they have near to no value if you don’t use the specific software.

Note: Chapter 18 is for sending email only from gmail, AT&amp;T, Comcast &amp; Verizon accounts. It doesn’t work with Outlook &amp; Yahoo. The sending of text messages to other people laid out is by using SMS Email Gateways and has many major drawbacks that make it not worth using in my opinion. The book also explains a way to send SMS to yourself, but no good alternative to sending messages to other people. I suggest using selenium for creating bulk draft emails or automating mailing lists if you use Outlook or Yahoo.

Another note: many people online seem to struggle to get programs to run from the command line using appendix B. I suggest googling how to do it instead as I feel like there's better guides online. You could also skip it for the time being and come back to it later, it's not of much use at the start of the book anyway.",learnpython,Unpopular opinion: you don't need to do all of Automate the Boring Stuff to learn the basics,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/fdhjsj/unpopular_opinion_you_dont_need_to_do_all_of/

48,bombapatch3kreborn,1583350642,fdie4g,4,1,"There is a ton of good tutorials on the net about how to make GUIs for databases and I was following one of them, everything was fine till all of them decided to use a listbox to show the data (listbox show them as a list in a single line). I wanted to show my data on a table just like you visualize it on the database terminal.

Im going to talk about 2 problems I had using a treeview (inserting data on a treeview and using select on a treeview to show the values on a entrybox).

&amp;#x200B;

So the first problem was not reading tkinter docs (maybe the whole problem) ""Treeview"" is just like listbox but shows stuff in a table, so thats it done, just insert the data just like a listbox but in a widget with a different name... Almost, in listbox you can just add it by :

&amp;#x200B;

for data in database.fetch\_all():    
lisbox.insert(END, data)            


&amp;#x200B;

And for a treeview the difference is it needs a index to know where to put stuff :

&amp;#x200B;

index = 0  
for data in database.fecth\_all():  
database.insert( """" ,  index,  values=rows)  
index = index + 1                                                  ###So for every data row,  you give a +1 index

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem I had was another small difference between Listbox and Treeview and how you use select event to pass the data selected on the table to an entry.

What we want to happen is ""click on the table row you want and get the data from there to an entry box"".

&amp;#x200B;

On a listbox:

\# bind the select to the listbox

 listbox.bind(""&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;"", select\_item)

 index = listbox.curselection()\[0\]

 selected\_item = listbox.get(index)

&amp;#x200B;

\# putting the selected item into a entry box

your\_entry.delete(0, END)

your\_entry.insert( END, selected\_item\[0\])

another\_entry.delete(0, END)

another\_entry.insert( END, selected\_item\[1\])

&amp;#x200B;

What I failed to understand was that select Treeview gives you the values in a different way than listbox so indexing like its a listbox will never work.

After literally ours trying to find how to do it I did what Einstein couln\`t ..... I... Printed(selected\_item) to see how treeview was giving the info(yeah guys before wasting ours searching what you dont understand just try to print it, please), Turns out Treeview gives the values in a dict, here:

print(selected\_item)

{'text': '', 'image': '', 'values': \[277, 'Hunter', ""O'Hederscoll"", 'Male', '1980-11-09', 'Budget/Accounting Analyst II', 'hohederscoll7o@dedecms.com', '75157.00', '2015-07-11', 1\], 'open': 0, 'tags': ''}     

   

TADAAAAAAAAA its a dict so if you ask for selected\_item\[0\] it will give you NOTHING.

You need to ask for  selected\_item\[""values""\]\[0\], selected\_item\[""values""\]\[1\] and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

\# bind select

treeview.bind(""&lt;&lt;TreeviewSelect&gt;&gt;"", select\_item)

index = treeview.selection()  
selected\_item = treeview.item(index)

&amp;#x200B;

\# putting the selected item into a entry box

your\_entry.delete(0, END)  
your\_entry.insert(END, selected\_item\['values'\]\[1\])  
another\_entry.delete(0, END)

For now, I will dump these .msg files to a folder, and open them like this:

    customer = x.find('person').find('name').get_text()
    phone = x.find('contact').find('cell').get_text()
    address = x.find('location').find('address').get_text()
    
    results = [customer, phone, address]

    import csv
    
    with open(""output + today_shortdate.csv"", ""w"", newline="""") as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerows(results)

Is there a more efficient/pythonic way to perform the above operation?  I'm still very new to Python and trying to preempt any bad techniques before they become bad habits.

PS - I intend to update the above script to loop through the folder, but eventually I would like to implement some kind of check to where it checks to see if the result exists, and if so, discards it, and if not, writes it to a master csv.

64,DAMO238,1583354144,fdja1a,4,1,"I have made a python script in python3.7 that uses a custom, modified version of gpt-2 to generate a message. I then used this inside another script to actually deploy it. (ie I import the [generator.py](https://generator.py) script in my main script and make a generator object there). However this takes up nearly all 4GB of my vram, which means I cannot be running this neural network in two places simultaneously. This is a problem because I also want to make a skill for mycroft (see [mycroft.ai](https://mycroft.ai) ) which would use python3.8. So what I need to do is modify the generation script to be self contained (and probably a daemon controlled by systemd). Getting these programs to interact would be challenging however, since they both need to pass in a prompt. I have had a few thoughts on how to do this, but none of them seem ideal:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Flask: This would allow me to simply ask the local server what to say which will then give a response. The problems I see with this method is if two requests come in at once, we could get into issues, and the generation times are fairly long (a few seconds for a few characters), meaning I may get timed out if it takes too long. There is also the challenge of sending a string with potentially weird characters (does this get automatically handled or will I have to think of literally every scenario because sometimes the bot gets a bit funky and decides to send Hindi or something even though it was never trained on Hindi...)
2. File communication: I could use a lockfile system where, when I want to make a message, I set the prompt in a file and create a lockfile to prevent another script using it and notify the generator that I want a response. The generator is checking for the lockfile every second or so and the removal of the lockfile notifies the original script that the generated text is now available. The downsides to this is the jankiness (I am sure there is a much better way to do this) and the problem that could happen if the lockfile is replaced before the original script checks, meaning the original script would read the wrong response (this could be alleviated using PID's I suppose, but that's even more jank!)
3. Something I don't know about yet. Ideally, I want to be able to call a function in another instance of python and get the result, but I doubt that's possible.

If a user goes through the entire script it's not a big deal, the end product files get written and then as long as everything was correct, there's no need to really store the variables or anything in the program since they are all in the output files. Where it's not good is if a user finds out they don't have all the details, I want them to be able to ""save"" where they are and just pick up later by pasting their string in.

While the script is running, everything is stored in a dictionary called `customer`. The script adds to the dictionary as the user adds more details, then creates a folder structure, DOCX, XLSX, and TXT files, ZIPs them all up and viola!

I'm stuck on the getting my details back into the script if I decide to ""save"" and quit.

    import ipaddress
    
    customer = {'customer_name':'Incomplete', 'id': 'Incomplete', 'pri_dc_code':'Incomplete', 'sec_dc_code':'Incomplete'}

Problem:

You are driving a little too fast, and  a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded  as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is  60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive,  the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is  your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

caught\_speeding(60, False) → 0  
caught\_speeding(65, False) → 1  
caught\_speeding(65, True) → 0  


My Code:

def caught\_speeding(speed, is\_birthday):

\#basis for not getting a ticket, doing under 60, or it's your birthday AND you're doing 5 over speed #limit

  if speed &lt;= 60 or (is\_birthday and (speed == 65 or speed == 66 or speed == 86)):

return 0

&amp;#x200B;

\#basis for getting a small ticket

\#if speed is between 61 and 80, then you get a small ticket OR it's your birthday AND you're doing 5 over +1 bc you're going too fast

  elif (61 &lt;= speed and speed &lt;= 80) or (is\_birthday and (67 &lt;= speed and speed &lt;= 87)):

return 1

&amp;#x200B;

\#basis for getting a fat ticket

\#if speed is greater than 81

  elif speed &gt;= 81:

82,pmacking,1583363775,fdlqi6,5,1,"I'd really appreciate some assistance troubleshooting my use of nested dictionaries in my first coding project (source on [GitHub](https://github.com/pmacking/MyProjects/tree/dev)).



playerDict is the main dict for storing 1 to 4 players' scoring options/scores representing the top, bottom, and totals sections of a yahtzee game (see bottom for sample playerDict). The diceDict is the dictionary which is mutated and referenced as the dice rolls continue.

Problem Code:

    def calcScore(player, playerDict, scoreSelected, diceDict):
        # calculate score based on scoreSelected in selectScore()
        if scoreSelected in playerDict[player]['scoreTop']:
            for d in diceDict.values():
                if d['result'] == playerDict[player]['scoreTop'][scoreSelected]['ref']:
                    playerDict[player]['scoreTop'][scoreSelected]['score'] += d['result']
                else:
                    playerDict[player]['scoreTop'][scoreSelected]['score'] += 0

Main Problem Description: for multiplayer games, in calcScore() above I cannot stop playerDict from incrementing the 'score' for all players. Given the arg player is passed to calcScore() as part of a wider scope for-player-loop, the intended result above is incrementing just that player's score. In the sample playerDict below (after one turn) Player1 chose 'Twos' to total the score of 2-dice. As you can see the correct score is also stored for Player2:

    {'Player1': {'scoreTop': {'Ones': {'ref': 1, 'score': False}, 'Twos': {'ref': 2, 'score': 8}, 'Threes': {'ref': 3, 'score': False}, 'Fours': {'ref': 4, 'score': False}, 'Fives': {'ref': 5, 'score': False}, 'Sixes': {'ref': 6, 'score': False}}, 'scoreBottom': {'Three of a kind': False, 'Four of a kind': False, 'Full house': False, 'Small straight': False, 'Large straight': False, 'Yahtzee': False, 'Chance': False, 'Yahtzee bonus': False}, 'totalScore': {'Sum of upper': False, 'Bonus': False, 'Total upper': False, 'Total bottom': False}, 'Grand total': False}, 'Player2': {'scoreTop': {'Ones': {'ref': 1, 'score': False}, 'Twos': {'ref': 2, 'score': 8}, 'Threes': {'ref': 3, 'score': False}, 'Fours': {'ref': 4, 'score': False}, 'Fives': {'ref': 5, 'score': False}, 'Sixes': {'ref': 6, 'score': False}}, 'scoreBottom': {'Three of a kind': False, 'Four of a kind': False, 'Full house': False, 'Small straight': False, 'Large straight': False, 'Yahtzee': False, 'Chance': False, 'Yahtzee bonus': False}, 'totalScore': {'Sum of upper': False, 'Bonus': False, 'Total upper': False, 'Total bottom': False}, 'Grand total': False}}


Question 1: what am I doing wrong in the calcScore() logic to cause this problem, or my dictionary structure, or both?



Bonus Questions: 

\- Is this a heinous use of nesting in a dictionary? I have no concept of 'good' dictionary data structures (resolving this gap in upcoming study materials)?

\- I've created dictionaries and assigned values to variables in the initial global scope like most projects: Why is it that when I call createPlayerDict(), I don't have to pass playerDict or scoringDict for the createPlayerDict to return playerDict accurately (note: I do have them saved as args in the GitHub code perhaps for no good reason)?... in the following call to yahtzeeRounds() I AM required to pass the args playerDict and diceDict to execute the function.

module_c has `from module_b import foo` and module_b has `from module_a import bar`  
in test_module_c I have `from src import module_c`  
  
when I run the code from project root with python -m unittest, I get the following error:
`ImportError: failed to import test module: test_module_c`  

The traceback takes me down to ../src/module_c.py  
`from module_c import module_b`  
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_b`  

I did try adding `from src import module_b` in addition to module_c, but then I got stuck with unable to import module_a, and when I tried importing all three, it wouldn't recognize module_a still. Hilariously enough (for me, at least), if I import module_c and module_a, it tells me it can't find module_b.  

I did try to look up these errors on stack overflow, but many of the suggestions found didn't work for me, so I'm hoping I'm just missing something really obvious since I don't really understand python that well.

Not really sure what `ssl` is, but I know that when I deployed my first site I set it up to use `https://`  which appears to involve `ssl.`

\- I  tried to upgrade `pip(`went from version 9 to 20) , this had no effect. Tried to upgrade pip and use `pip3`, no effect. 

Being that the commands to create a project/app are still working, this seems more like a warning than an error? Should I even be concerned (hard not to be concerned lol)?

I'm working with switch configs, and need to do different processing on an IP address both standalone, and as part of HSRP(not relevant but some may know what i'm talking about).  Just so you can get a visual of what's going on, here's the relevant piece of the interface:

interface Vlan123  
ip address [10.10.10.1](https://10.10.10.1)

What I need to do is take that IP address and use it as a standby IP address later on in the interface configuration, but also increment it by 1 on the IP address line.  Here's what the finished product should look like:

interface Vlan123  
ip address [10.10.10.2](https://10.10.10.2)  
.  
..  
...  
standby 4 ip [10.10.10.1](https://10.10.10.1)

So I've already been able to pull that IP address and put it into the standby line......did that with a dictionary.  Where I'm drawing a blank is how and where to increment the original IP address line since Python is linear in processing.   Below is how I pulled the original IP and put it in the standby line:

match = re.match(r'\^ ip address (\[0-9\]+\\.\[0-9\]+\\.\[0-9\]+\\.\[0-9\]+)', line)  
if match:  
d\[""ip""\] = [match.group](https://match.group)(1)

' standby 4 ip '+ d\[""ip""\] + '\\n'\\

I'm writing a basic code that recognizes objects in an image. I've gotten to the point where I can express the image as a 2d array of 0s and 1s, where the 1s represent the location of the object. So the array is filled with mostly 0s, with one big cluster of 1s somewhere (the object) and sporadic 1s throughout the rest of it. The sporadic 1s are ""noise"" that were incorrectly flagged as the object.

I'm looking for an algorithm which can efficiently find the main cluster of 1s in the array, so that I can separate the object from the noise. I'm sure there has to be a ""pythonic"" way to do it in 1-2 lines, perhaps within scipy or numpy. I know there are a million variations of clustering algorithms out there, but the majority of them sound unnecessarily complicated and I haven't found a simple solution that suits my needs.

Exercise 1.1 from your textbook recommends that you try to make mistakes when experimenting with a new programming feature. 

This  kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when  you are programming because you get to know what the error messages  mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and  accidentally. (Downey, 2015, 7)

For this Learning Journal, first, answer the following questions based on Exercise 1.1. **Include example Python code and output with your answers.**

* If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks or both and why?  

* You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens for each of the following and why?  


\&gt;&gt;&gt; 2++2  
\&gt;&gt;&gt; 2--2  
\&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+-2  
\&gt;&gt;&gt; 2-+2

* In math notation, leading zeros are OK, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python and why?  

* What happens if you have two values with no operator and a space in between them and why?  


**Part 2:**

Next, describe at least **three** additional Python experiments that you tried while learning Chapter 1. Show the Python inputs and their outputs, and **explain what you learned** from the results of each example. ",learnpython,Help on Python Exercise,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/ey5gfj/help_on_python_exercise/

&gt; Fantasy Game Inventory  
&gt;  
&gt;You are creating a fantasy video game. The data  structure to model the player’s inventory will be a dictionary where the  keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the  value is an integer value detailing how many of that item the player  has. For example, the dictionary value {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12} means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Write a function named displayInventory() that would take any possible “inventory” and display it like the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;Inventory:  
 12 arrow  
 42 gold coin  
 1 rope  
 6 torch  
 1 dagger  
 Total number of items: 62  
&gt;  
&gt;Hint: You can use a for loop to loop through all the keys in a dictionary.

    # inventory.py
 stuff = {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12}

    def displayInventory(inventory):
     print(""Inventory:"")
     item_total = 0
     for k, v in inventory.items():
         # FILL THIS PART IN
     print(""Total number of items: "" + str(item_total))

    displayInventory(stuff)

      Request(easy)- to send and read parsed data from web
       JSON(easy)- to interact with APIs
      IO (easy)- Byte manipulation

PyAutoGUI (not sure)- Honestly I've just heard about it and hoping y'all can help me out
PyAutoGUI projects- a dude on here made a hand controlled Chrome dinosaur game. Move a mouse, track mouse movement.  


Tensor flow (easy)- This is the go to for ML and Python is best suited for ML so tensor is a must learn Module. TensorFlow paired up with IoT and you're making revolutionary inventions, of course you'll need ideas. It's a relatively new field and It can be over whelming at first but honestly it's one of the easier modules and has a great community, developed by Google Brain Team need i say more.

**NOTE:** I have just started learning this stuff and likely do not know what im doing and will struggle to understand most complex explinations

 

 

Write a Python program that simulate a cash register for a commercial shop. Assume   that the business of this shop is run in a special way as follows:

* It sells goods of $5 dollars’ multiples, i.e., all goods are priced 5, 10, 15, … etc all princes are prices that can be divided by five evenly.
* The customers have to pay for their purchased goods cash. The cash they pay have to be of exact number of notes that are needed to cover their bills. The denominations used to pay the bill should starting by the $100 notes, then $50 notes, then $20 notes, then $10, and finally by the $5 notes.  
For example: For a bill amount of $375, the customer must pay: 1) three notes of $100, 2) one note of $50, 3) one note of $20, and 4) one note of $5.

The program should ask the user to enter the amount of the bill to be paid for his/her purchases. The program should loop indefinitely to collect bills until the user Enter ‘0’ zero, only then the program prints on the screen the number of notes of each denomination that should be in the cash register. Then the program comes to halt.

The program should have in addition to the main() function the following functions:  


1. **Bill** function: to collect a bill amount from the user or ‘0’ to print the total and quit. This function returns the entered bill amount or ‘0.’
2. **Denomination** function: It takes as an input the bill amount returned by function 1 above, then this function returns the correct number of notes as described above.
3. **DenominationAccumulation** function: It takes as an input the number of notes returned from the function 2 above, then this function adds those denomination notes to accumulated notes already collected in the cash register.
4. As explained above, the program should loop indefinitely collecting bills, break them down to proper number of denominations, and calculate the accumulated number of notes of all denominations. The program should keep on doing that until the user enters ‘0’ upon which the program would invoke a function called “**PrintTotalDenom**” that would print the total number of notes of each denomination.

All the above 4 functions should be called and dealt with from within (inside) the main function, but written outside the main function, of course. Also, the main function should start with the following:

**global acDen**

**acDen={'h100':0,'f50':0,'t20':0,'t10':0,'f5':0}**

In the first line we declare a global variable call ‘acDen’ (Stands for accumulated denominations).

In the second line we create a dictionary that define the accumulated denominations to zeros as a start.

Below is an example of how the program runs:

**Enter a bill  amount**

**or 0 Zero to get the**

**total denominations : 250**

**Enter a bill  amount**

**or 0 Zero to get the**

**total denominations : 175**

**Enter a bill  amount**

**or 0 Zero to get the**

**total denominations : 10**

**Enter a bill  amount**

**or 0 Zero to get the**

**total denominations : 0**

**No. of $100 bills :    3**

**No. of  $50 bills :    2**

**No. of  $20 bills :    1**

**No. of  $10 bills :    1**

**No. of   $5 bills :    1**",learnpython,"Got an assingment, unsure about how to start with it",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/eyacgt/got_an_assingment_unsure_about_how_to_start_with/

In my project, I have two levels, root and reader. Inside root I have my \_\_init\_\_.py, constants.py, controller.py and directory reader. Inside reader, I have \_\_init\_\_.py, file\_reader.py and test.py.

file\_reader.py

**from constants import STARTING\_PARAMETER, STATUS\_CODE, HEADER, ERROR\_PATH**

controller.py

**import constants, reader**

**from root.constants import STARTING\_PARAMETER, STATUS\_CODE, HEADER, ERROR\_PATH**

It gives me ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'root'.

I understand that I'm executing from controller.py thus using the same directory, root, as a base. My doubt is, if in the future I want to import and use file\_reader.py in another module that is not in the root directory, it won't let me import constants, giving me the error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'constants'.

Is there a right way to import constants.py to file\_reader.py, and after, import file\_reader.py in any other module, including in the root directory, without errors?

I'm a 32 year old, learning programming without a computer degree.

I've a Diploma in Mechanical &amp; worked as a CAD Engineer in civil field, then i broke my leg in an accident, recovered, started working again, again broke my leg, after multiple surgeries, i recovered &amp; i struggled to find jobs.

For the past two years i'm working as system engg (or whatever) for a small computer solutions, the company is owned by one of my friend, i get paid more like weekly or based on work (i pick &amp; choose jobs) bcoz i don't travel longer distance, still not fully recovered. Mostly the work is to install refurbished computers to schools, colleges &amp; offices with windows, linux &amp; other softwares.

Recently while working at a school, i met a software engg who recommended me to learn about programming &amp; don't worry about degree. Told me learn web development or focus on AI later when i comfortable in programming bcoz its the future.

So i searched for more answers, more i searched, i got more confused.

* Took a basic course in Java bcoz i like to flash custom roms &amp; kernels on my android device but i found it difficult to understand.
* Then tried web development, i was bored not interested, never been a artist.
* Took a CS50 course, first few hours was wonderful, but they went deep in C, my head started to explode, so stopped it there.
* Finally thinking about Python, took beginner course by sentdex &amp; i was interested but it was bit confusing, the course was about tic tac toe game (ffs i never knew about this game).

So i want to focus on Python, lot of people recommended Python Crash Course &amp; Automate boring stuff.

Purchased a Python Crash Course book &amp; started it few weeks back, everything was good, i was getting confused few times but i solved all the exercises,d, then testing your code chapter was very difficult to understand. 

Few days back i started project ""Alien Invasion"" a pygame, finished the first part, now i'm still confused with functions sometimes, where to use for loops &amp; while loops, mainly trouble with understanding refactoring, helper method.

Started to feel the impostor syndrome, i deleted my twitter account where i was using #100dayscode challenge from day1 of learning python &amp; even my reddit account bcoz i was already feeling the pressure of failure.

So took a break to think about it &amp; now i need you help:

* Should i continue the pygame project in python crash course or start Automate the boring stuff, learning the basics again &amp; comeback to python crash course when i feel comfortable or start coding just some stuff on internet?

I get the k \_KT is the key I want to get, but that isn't directly obvious - I just know that from using Get methods on dictionaries in other programming languages. I had to google to find out that union\[\_VT\_co, \_T\] is essentially the string to return if the key isn't found in the dictionary. Still no idea what ""VT\_co"" actually stands for though. 

My question is, is this a problem in my Python setup that isn't making it user friendly, or is that how it appears for any code editor I use? In which case, how do I better understand what it expects as parameters/arguments for the method call? Do I have to google each one when I want to use something new and try to remember them all?

I'm several hours into this problem and feel like I've tried everything I can think of to solve this Python problem. The jist of the problem is this. Below are the conditions  set out and what they're trying to throw back as I understand it. For example if an age is 7 and rating is ""G"" then the test would allow a kid to see a G rated movie, age 15 and rating ""R"" wouldn't allow someone under age 17 to see that movie and so on:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Any child can see a G-rated movie.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- To see a PG-rated movie, your child must be 8 or older.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- To see a PG-13-rated movie, your child must be 13 or older.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- To see an R-rated movie, your child must be 17 or older.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Your child may never see an NC-17 movie.  
&gt;  
&gt;The variables above give a rating and a child's age. Use these variables to select and print one of these two messages based on the criteria above:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- ""You may see that movie!""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- ""You may not see that movie!""  
&gt;  
&gt;\#However, there's one trick: you may not use the 'and' operator anywhere in this code!

&amp;#x200B;

It reckon the solution has to be a nested conditional solution since the solution can't use AND anywhere in the program. After several hours of trying everything I can think of, this is where I'm, first, asking what could be the 'indentation error' that I'm receiving on line 23 and is this even the right track towards solving this problem? I just can't tell anymore and if that's partly from hammering away at it for so long or the instructions aren't clear or something else.

Previous attempts and re-reading literature about nested conditionals made me think my original ideas weren't formatted correctly and therefore were throwing weird answers. I added a little comment next to each if/else to try to keep track of where everything is going but else:#b keeps coming back as an indentation error. I'm honestly not sure why - I've tried moving it around, commenting out other elses to see if it changes but nothing works.

We were asked to do a project for our programming fundamentals class, and I had (stupidly) decided to go for real time messaging app. The thing is, our professor was rejecting any ideas that he thought were too ""easy"" and just started assigning projects to the students who proposed those easy ideas. So, I had no choice but to go for this idea instead. I have done a lot of research and quite a bit about sockets and how they're used in this case. (Still not enough though because I still have no idea what I'm doing) .

I found a video made by sentdex on YouTube. I am currently trying to understand the code and how it works. However , he didn't really explain the process well. I might be asking for a lot, but could someone please explain this code? I understand what's happening until server\_socket=socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_STREAM). I don't really understand anything after that.

Live demo at [https://ptmcg.pythonanywhere.com/arithrepl](https://ptmcg.pythonanywhere.com/arithrepl) \- in-browser buttons are provided for entering Unicode characters (Unicode arithmetic operators like × and ÷, Greek letters, and subscript digits). Enter 'help' to see functions and operators. (If the demo is flaky, I apologize in advance - please chalk that up to my lame Javascript skills.)

The intent of this library is so that arithmetic parsers can be embedded in your own Python app, as shown in the sample code if you enter the 'code' command. The lib also allows parsers to be customized with your own added functions and operators.

Still in development, I hope to push this out as an alpha release in the next few weeks. (Python 3 only)

Some background: It turns out this is a fairly common question here in r/learnpython and on SO, and the only built-in option is the dangerous `eval()` function. I wrote pyparsing's `infixNotation` method for people to implement their own arithmetic parsers, but apparently its interface is still a bit daunting, especially for newcomers. So I wrote this thin layer above it for a more ready-to-go-out-of-the-box experience. Early feedback has shown up some DOS-holes which I think I have addressed, but so far no actual security holes.

42,stealthfield,1578154441,ejyhrv,10,0,"Hello /r/learnpython,

I am building a generic set of cards and would like to know if I structuring this poorly (my general OOP is bad) or in a non-Pythonic way? I've found numerous ""simple deck of cards"" examples, but I am looking to over-architect (""advanced deck of cards"") this to learn more on structure and reuse portions later in other projects.

General programming questions, if you have the time:

* Is there a better way to layout this namespace with Python?
* If a property of a class is just an `Enum` (example code below), should it just live in the main class's file if it's not anywhere else? (I liked it as it's own file if I needed to add extra properties, I just jump straight to the particular file.)

The way I have it, seems like a bunch of imports where if I'm constructing cards in a loop in the deck.py file, seems like something that should happen more auto-magically.

The directory structure presently looks like this:

    ~/cardgame/ # (empty top level directory)
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/ # (sub-directory)
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/__init__.py # (empty file, not sure what to do with this)
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/card.py
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/color.py
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/deck.py # (currently empty)
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/rank.py
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/suit.py
    ~/cardgame/cardgame/symbol.py

Examples of what the file content would be:

    # color.py
    from enum import Enum, auto
    class Color(Enum):
        Red = auto()
        Black = auto()
        
    
    # symbol.py
    from enum import Enum, auto
    class Symbol(Enum):
        Spades = auto()
        Diamonds = auto()
        Clubs = auto()
        Hearts = auto()
    
    # suit.py
    from cardgame.color import Color
    from cardgame.symbol import Symbol
    class Suit:
        def __init__(self, color: Color, symbol: Symbol):
            self.color = color
            self.symbol = symbol
    
    # card.py
    from cardgame.color import Color
    from cardgame.rank import Rank
    from cardgame.suit import Suit
    from cardgame.symbol import Symbol
    # ... and so on ...
    class Card:
        def __init__(self, suit: Suit, rank: Rank):

45,OhHiClark,1578156942,ejz1dt,3,1,"Hi,

I'm working through an example in ""Python Crash Course"" (Eric Matthes), where I am passing multiple keyword arguments to a function that creates a dictionary with it, as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

`def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):  # User_info is an empty dictionary`

	`"""""" Build a dictionary with everything we know about a user """"""`

	`profile = {}`

	`profile['first_name'] = first   		# Dictionary[key] = value`

	`profile['last_name'] = last`

	`for key, value in user_info.items():	# You don't know what the user info will contain`

		`profile[key] = value`

	`return profile`

&amp;#x200B;

`user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein', location = 'princeton', field = 'physics')`

`print(user_profile)`

The code works fine (copied from the textbook), but I am not sure about one thing. 

A dictionary with string-keywords is returned of the form:

 {'first\_name': 'albert', 'last\_name': 'einstein', 'location': 'princeton', 'field': 'physics'}

If I understand correctly, I'm providing keyword arguments in to the function build\_profile, namely *location = 'princeton'* and *field = 'physics'.* 

What I am unsure about is how the keyword information (location and field) enters the dictionary with the quotes ' ' around them eventhough I did not specify it as such. I know it has to happen, it's just the structure of the dictionary. I also know the quotes can't be in the argument when calling the function (e.g. 'location' = 'princeton'), since we're feeding the function a key word argument. But I'm not sure what part of the function accomplishes the quotes. The dictionary *user\_info* that has been created apparently already has the quotes ' ' around the keywords before it puts the info in the dictionary *profile,* but I don't understand how that happens.

55,Joemomss,1578163276,ek0i1n,20,8,"Hello r/learnpython,

I'm learning the language by moving through [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/mobilebasic?usp=gmail) project list. Right now I'm working on the 'Menu Calculator' 

I made my menu a dictionary, like this:

    menu = {
        1: {""item"": ""Chicken Strips"", ""price:"": 3.50},
        2: {""item"": ""French Fries"", ""price"": 2.50},
        3: {""item"": ""Hamburger"", ""price"": 4.00},
        4: {""item"": ""Hotdog"", ""price:"": 3.50},
        5: {""item"": ""Salad"", ""price:"": 3.75},
        6: {""item"": ""Small Drink"", ""price:"": 1.25},
        7: {""item"": ""Medium Drink"", ""price:"": 1.50},
        8: {""item"": ""Large Drink"", ""price:"": 1.75},
        9: {""item"": ""Milk Shake"", ""price:"": 2.25}
    }
    

I then used some nested for loops to print the menu before each user input:

        for x, y in menu.items():
            print(x, end="". "")
            for a, b in y.items():
                print(str(b), end="" "")
                i += 1
                if i == 1:
                    print("" $"", end="""")
                if i == 2:
                    print("""")
                    i = 0
    

This looks good to me, but when the prices are printed out they cut off trailing zeros. To fix this I tried to use the quantize() method out of the decimal module. To implement this I changed the above code to:

        for x, y in menu.items():
            print(x, end="". "")
            for a, b in y.items():
                print(str(b.quantize(decimal.Decimal('0.00'))), end="" "")
                i += 1
                if i == 1:
                    print("" $"", end="""")
                if i == 2:
                    print("""")
                    i = 0
    

After changing the code, I'm getting this error: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'quantize'

I'm confused because I took that line from one of my previous projects. The only difference is that for my previous project it was working directly on a variable:

    change = payment - price
    
        print(""Change due: $"" + str(change.quantize(dec('0.00'))))

Whereas for this project I'm trying to use it on the iterator of a for loop. Is this treated differently? As far as I know, I should be able to treat the iterator just like a variable.

Any help with this issue is greatly appreciated. And I'm open to any constructive criticism regarding the code in general as well.

Right now I come up with an idea, I maybe plan out a few things I want the program to do. I then dive right in and start building out functions and classes.

After an hour or so of this, I then look at all my beautiful functions and classes and wonder ""How the heck do I pieces all these together?""

I then made a post asking for help on a project I was doing. I got a lot of good feedback but one of the best takeaways was that my functions should either print something or return values, not both at the same time. There must be some sort of separation. 

I want to know where do I go to learn things like this. Like...

* Which classes go in what file
* Which functions go in what file
* What to name these files
* How to properly catch errors
* How to properly organize a program

I think this is the next step. I appreciate any feedback on this and will listen but I would prefer links or recommendations to resources.

63,graciousgroob,1578168822,ek1rd8,13,1,"I am working on (my first) project that uses multiple, rather large custom classes. It gotten to the point where I got tired of scrolling through hundreds or even thousands of lines of code when switching between classes, so I thought that it would make sense to just put separate classes into different files and import them into a main file.

The problem is that many of these custom classes use the same packages as dependencies, and also share some global variables. for example, i currently am doing it like this:
     
     import numpy as np
     global_variable = #something all classes reference

     class A():
          #Do some stuff that uses numpy
          #Do stuff with global_variable
         instance_b = B()

     class B():
          #do other stuff with numpy
          #do stuff with global_variable


which is fine when when the classes are only a couple lines of code, but gets to be a pain to work on when they are really long. But when I split them up, I am forced (i think) to import numpy twice, and store two copies of global_variable:

file_1:

    import numpy as np
    global_variable = #something all classes reference
    from file_2 import B
    class A():
         #Do some stuff that uses numpy
         #Do stuff with global_variable
         instance_b = B()

file_2:

    import numpy as np
    global_variable = #something all classes reference
    class B():
         #do other stuff with numpy
         #do stuff with global_variable

What do you all do to get around the problem of either double loading dependencies, or scrolling scrolling scrolling up and down through lots of code?

I was wondering if its possible to automate this process. I.e. take a list of addresses, and then have python enter them one by one into the website and record the cost estimates.
Maybe i can make a heatmap of this or something later on.
The way the website works is that you input the house number and zip code, and then click to confirm the address it finds.

Im aware of beautifulsoup, but was wondering what tools can automate the form submission and onward?

Any direction is appreciated thanks!

I want to learn to code in 2020. I pick up a new ""skill"" every year. Last year was guitar. I really devote time to the skill I'm learning. I have a 2 hour time slot in my schedule every day for the learning of the new skill.

I am interested in learning python, but am having trouble finding a tutorial/course/teaching method that really clicks for me. My desire to learn python comes from being interested in map-making, specifically using QGIS and Blender, which utilize python. I am finding that many tasks in the map-making process would be easier, or even possible, by utilizing python.

I've tried a few beginner python tutorials and am finding it difficult, I think primarily because I'm used to working in fields which heavily emphasize visuals (e.g. GIS, computer graphics, geology). The beginner python tutorials I've seen do not include some sort of visual output. **So, do you know of any resources for learning python with a focus on creating graphics or visual displays?**

I think a python tutorial with more visuals would help me out, but if you have other suggestions for learning python to advance an understanding of GIS or digital graphic software, I'd be happy to hear it!

What this code does is simulate foot traffic to a store. The variable names 'possible\_custs\_n' randomly generates a number of customers for each hour the store is open in a day.

The output of this function is then utilized to calculate a random number of item's purchased (inventory is only 5 items right now) by each customer and totals up the customers purchases and the days purchases. I have all that coded. The next step is having this all exported, in a usable format, to a csv file.

or if I had an existing 2D array in Python, use a for loop to go through every entry and create a button with the button's text being the content of that entry. 

2. If the user clicks on the GUI's close button there should be a popup prompting the user to confirm the decision to close the GUI. So the popup should also have  ""OK"" and ""Cancel"" buttons alongside the current text in the code below. 

`window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout)`

`while True:`

`event, values =` [`window.read`](https://window.read)`()`

`if event in (None, 'Cancel'):	# if user closes window or clicks cancel`

`sg.Popup('Are you sure you want to disconnect from the game?')`

I haven't found documentation showing how to embed buttons in a sg.popup element. I found that there are buttons in the sg.popup\_get\_file element, but I do not need the popup to open files. 

I'm guessing after I embed the buttons in a popup I also can use ButtonCallBack on those buttons to either close the GUI or close the popup and remain in the GUI.",learnpython,PySimpleGUI Using for loop to create a grid/matrix of buttons and adding buttons to sg.Popup(),1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/e62we7/pysimplegui_using_for_loop_to_create_a_gridmatrix/

I saw a this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/e5tzsl/learning_programming_seems_like_a_daunting_task/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) that appears that people are having a lot difficulties while learning programming and getting down. It's not the idea, coding should be something gratifying and not a pain in the a\*\*.

I've been programming since 2010 and I know how it feels to learn a lot of something but never being good at nothing. I've become an actual programmer not so long ago actually, I use to build web apps but having no idea how frameworks works, actually building a social network was the first ""real project"" I made a few years ago and the only difference with other projects was using ""Relationships"" on the database. Things like this could make a big difference on new ideas for new projects but how many of this kind of things are there that we could take advantage of? Making cool stuffs. The idea is being entertained by learning and not just having headaches and becoming depressed.

I'm about to start making video courses to teach programming for getting a few income, not just Python syntax but for learning to program not just copy pasting code to build websites, actually learning also how web frameworks are made. Of course just coding is still boring so each course would have a cool project useful for something, like simple console applications, games using OpenGL, getting data from websites for data science or building webapps. Covering Python syntax, real program structures and version control, Functional programming, Object oriented programming, choosing a good IDE, debugging, memory and CPU profiling, algorithms and design patterns, standard modules, Machine Learning, etc. Would you buy something like this? I've already made tutorials in English and have very good ratings but this would be different, more for long terms. Learning real programming so if you want to learn another language would be easy as cake.

I could also teach individually but having theses courses would make things very easy since my teaching intentions would be for you to learn learning without having to go back again to understand something and then retaking where you left so if there would be any question I would already know the context.

I like making these videos so if there are people interested I would make it.

\*What I'm currently doing\*:

Reading ""Crash Course Python"" while roaming around the internet looking for as much info as possible on everything. I've watched a 4h course by freecodecamp on YouTube about python programming.

\*Overview of what I want to do\*:

\- I want to make my own legal database program for pc. I understand (I think) that SQL is the way to go for databases, but I don't know if I should use a premade one or start from scratch (I'd prefer the latter). I also want to use PyQt5 for the GUI because I think Tkinter looks a bit too old but it has more information online and in books I think. Also, I've been looking up stuff about json files and was wondering which would better suit my needs: using json or using databases with sql.

\- I want to write software that generates contracts, terms &amp; conditions, ... based on input of the user. I know that websites like community.lawyer already exist, but I want to create my own website that takes user info and generates pdfs based on the input. Learning how to set up an e-shop online would also be nice, but I've seen that there's a course by freecodecamp on youtube for that.

\- I want to write applications that search through a large amount of documents for certain information like judgements etc. Just to analyse those documents.

\- I just want general and thorough knowledge about computer science and technology to further help future clients and really understand what they want. I know Harvard has made an online course (CS50 for lawyers) but I was wondering if there are also other good resources you could advise me.

So, I just don't know where to begin. I would prefer to stay away from the too mathematical stuff (if that makes sense) and go for the practical aspects. I'm not here to create game engines etc.

In the video (at 3:46), there is the claim at ""names are reassigned independently"". Ned did plenty of examples using the `.append()` method, but did not assign any values to list elements directly. From the info in talk, I inferred that list elements also function like names, but this seems to be flawed on my part. For example:

    myList = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    newList = myList
    
    myList[0] = ""hello""
    
    # this acts as if we rebinded newList[0]
    print(newList[0]) # hello

I have a projectile class: 

    class Projectile:
        def __init__(self, angle, velocity, height):
            self.xpos = 0.0 # starting at the origin
            self.ypos = height # y value will be the height which user specifies.
            theta = math.radians(angle)
            self.xvel = velocity * math.cos(theta) # cos will give us x axis parameter for velocity
            self.yvel = velocity * math.sin(theta) # sin will give us y axis parameter for velocity
        # the current position is stored in the instance xpos and ypos as this will update as projectile is fired   

        def getX(self):
            return self.xpos
        def getY(self):
            return self.ypos
    
        # now the updated position is stored. It must now be updated so elapsed time is reflected.
        def update(self, time):
            self.xpos = self.xpos + time * self.xvel # will track the motion of the projectile
            yvel1 = self.yvel - 9.8 * time # acceleration of gravity on the porjectile in motion
            self.ypos = self.ypos + time * (self.yvel + yvel1) / 2.0
        # position is the initial value plus time multiplied by the motion of the projectile in action. 
            self.yvel = yvel1 # updating the self.yvel variable after the calculation

a shot tracking class: 

    class shottracker(Projectile, cuplist): 
        def __init__(self, win, angle, velocity, height): 
        """"""win is the GraphWin to display the shot. angle, velocity, and height are initial projectile parameters""""""
            self.proj = Projectile(angle, velocity, height) # Attributes of the cannonball motion
            self.marker = Circle(Point(0,height),3)
            self.marker.setFill(""black"") # Cannonball color
            self.marker.setOutline(""black"") # The cannonball outline color
            self.marker.draw(win)
            self.cuplist = cuplist # tracker is establishing the cuplist 


        def update(self,dt):  # This function updates the position and is responsible for the animation
            self.proj.update(dt)
            center = self.marker.getCenter()
            dx = self.proj.getX() - center.getX()
            dy = self.proj.getY() - center.getY()
            if dy == 0:
                for c in cuplist:
                    if c.collision(dx) == True: #undraw cup
                        cuplist.remove(c) # cup is removed 
            self.marker.move(dx,dy)

        def getX(self):
            return self.proj.getX()

            self.startX = irand # startX is the starting position of the cup on the axis 
            self.endX = irand + diameter # end of the cup on the x axis ( start plus diameter)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very new to Python, so have been looking at some projects. I've begun one where I have wrote a program that will give me the total number of coin holders required for a certain weight of coins is returned. I have that working fine but now wish to optimize. Here's my code for reference: (

&amp;#x200B;

import math  


coin = input(""Please select which coin you would like to package: \\n""

 while coin != 9:  
 if coin == 1:  
weight= float(input(""What is the weight of the total amount of coins: ""))  
individualcoins = weight / 3.56  
 individualcoins = math.ceil(individualcoins)  
canhold = math.ceil(individualcoins / 50)  
 print(""You will need"",  canhold,""holders to hold"",individualcoins,""1p coins"")

cointype(coin)  


\#step 1: divide the weight of the total coins by the individual coin weight and round to nearest whole  
\#step 2: divide that number by how many coins a holder can hold and round to nearest whole number  
to optimize, I plan on creating a dictionary such as coinweights {{""1p"": 3.56, ""2p"": 7.12} etc and then pass the values into the individualcoins variable.

I have NO idea how to pull only the values in. I have googled my heart out, and I may just not be able to put it in the right words, but it always return including a for loop. I would like to know is there a way to do it without the for loop?

I am using ldap3 package to connect with ldap server and check user credentials.

However when I am trying to connect with wrong username and password, connection response looks liek this:

I'm writing a program that imports two modules from other .py files. One is a graphics package and one is a function file of my own.

&amp;#x200B;

the import from my own file needs to use a function\[\*\*bold\*\*.draw\*\*bold\*\*\] from the graphics package.

&amp;#x200B;

so my function has:

\*\*bold\*\*command.draw()\*\*bold\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

but when I run the program I get an error:

\*\*bold\*\*AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'draw'\*\*bold\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First I thought it might be a scope issue, but I've been tinkering and realized that if I run, in the main body:

\*\*bold\*\*command = Rectangle(Point(250,300), Point(500,500))\*\*bold\*\*

\*\*bold\*\*command.draw(win)\*\*bold\*\*

it runs fine... however if I run:

\*\*bold\*\*command= Rectangle(Point(250,300), Point(500,500))\*\*bold\*\*

\*\*bold\*\*command= str(aRectangle)\*\*bold\*\*

\*\*bold\*\*command.draw(win)\*\*bold\*\*

I get the same AttributeError

&amp;#x200B;

so heres the program flow where i think the issue is:

I'm importing the 'commands' from a .cmd file that has one command per line, processing it line by line by putting it into a list \[\*\*bold\*\*cmdlist = commandfile.readlines() \*\*bold\*\*\] and iterating through the list with a for loop\[\*\*bold\*\*for i in cmdlist\*\*bold\*\*\], and if the line begins with an alpha character(getting rid of #comments, etc) im assigning it with \*\*bold\*\*command = i\*\*bold\*\* then drawing with command.draw(win)

I'm assuming the 'command' is assigned a string attribute when i initially create \*\*bold\*\*cmdlist\*\*bold\*\* but I don't know how to remove this attribute so the command can be used with .draw.

\[('2018-07', -3), ('2018-8', 15)\]

97,JustinianusI,1575550136,e6gqbv,7,1,"Hey all! I'm learning about dataframes and pandas and whatnot and I decided to try and play around with the RCP polling average. (The script below imports the polling average and the previous 49 polls for the Democratic presidential primary, changes the index to the numbers 50-1, then flips the graphs so the numbers ascend. (Essentially, because the most recent poll is first, the x-axis would show the polling going the wrong way, it's a whole thing).)

Anyway, as some of you may know, Michael Bloomberg just entered the presidential race, which means that there is no polling on him before a couple weeks ago. RCP designates this as '--', so I replace it all with 0. (I was listening to halo when I wrote this which is why the variable is called halo. Haloooooooooo. Now you just want to sing along too.)

    
    halo = pd.read_html(""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html#polls"")[2]
    halo.index = nums
    halo.sort_index(inplace=True)
    halo['Bloomberg'].replace(to_replace='--', value=int(0), inplace=True)
    halo.head(5)

Anyway, after that, I wrote the following, which takes a candidate name and plots the polls with a couple moving averages. I tested it on various candidates, from Biden to Harris to Yang, etc. It always comes up with a graph. However, Michael Bloomberg kills my pandas.

    candidate = 'Harris'
    
    halo[candidate].plot(figsize=(16,6), legend=True, label=f'{candidate} Poll Result')
    halo[f'{candidate} Moving Average 5 Poll'] = halo[candidate].rolling(5).mean()
    halo[f'{candidate} Moving Average 20 Poll'] = halo[candidate].rolling(20).mean()
    halo[f'{candidate} Moving Average 5 Poll'].plot(legend=True, label='5 Poll Average')
    halo[f'{candidate} Moving Average 20 Poll'].plot(legend=True, label='20 Poll Average')

I get the following error message when I replace 'Harris' with 'Bloomberg':

    TypeError: Empty 'DataFrame': no numeric data to plot

Please help bring my pandas back to life :( . (I know much of my code is unclear or somewhat off, and that it isn't particularly helpful for mapping the polls, and that I should use a datetime index, etc. I just wanted to play around with pandas a bit. Also, sorry if you support Bloomberg. I'm sure he's very nice to pandas. And groundhogs. I'm looking at you, [DeBlasio](https://time.com/3430689/groundhog-bill-de-blasio-nyc/)).

I've been making a game that I can use for teaching English in class using Pygame.

It works well enough but there are a couple of things I wish I could find a solution for, and I hoped some of you here might know.

Firstly - does anyone know how I can specify to Pygame that I want the window to open on the other monitor? I use the game by dragging it onto the projector's side of the screen, but it would be so much cooler if I could just have it open there in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Second - When I do use the game on my default screen, it opens a window of the correct size, minimized. If I maximise that window, you can see a sort of after-image beyond the size of the pygame's display area that doesn't get updated.

30,VainerCactus0,1572878768,driki7,3,2,"I don't really have a problem here, I managed to solve that problem, although the solution was a little janky, but it works. I am just curious, and would like to know why this bit of code produces this result. I have included the minimum viable code to produce the result. 

Basically, the planet instance called planet1 is orbiting as per its orbit method. I call the canvas.create to have a circle shape around this planet, this is called self.show here. I figured if I told self.show to go to the same coords as the planet goes to using goto, they would be in the exact same place. However, if you run this code, you will see that self.show is lagging behind planet1. I was very confused by this. I tried changing how x and y is calculated for canvas.coords, using self.pos() and self.xcor()/self.ycor() to grab the planet1 turtles location and transfer it to the tkinter object. This had the exact same effect. If you uncomment out self.show2, self.show3 and run the code, you will see that these 2 colour coded circles are in different places on the orbit. If you look at where angle, angle2 and angle3 are defined, you'll see that self.t is modified before I divide it by 2*pi.

What I want to understand is, why does the tkinter circle lag behind the turtle? 
The only thing I can think of, is maybe turtle and tkinter use different coordinate systems, which when combined in the way I have done here, causes this odd phenomena. I have tested this on IDLE and Jupyter Notebook.

This is my first time posting here, if I have violated any rules, I will happily take this post down. I am also very new to programming, I would be grateful for any general tips on not having suboptimal code. Please let me know if there is any information I have left out, I will respond tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently posted (and was helped, thank you very much!) on this sub a question about code in getting an RPi to communicate with an RFID module.  That problem's been solved, but I have a question.

&amp;#x200B;

Our project is (hopefully) programming an RPi to activate an LED (using GPIO and/or breadboard, whichever would be easier) when the RFID module detects an RFID tag.  As I said, we've successfully written to/read from the RFID tag, but now, we'd like to have an LED illuminate when the RFID tag is detected.    


Is this possible?  It's probably obvious from my post that we have very little idea what we're doing (my 4th grader and I are learning as we go as best we can).  His project idea is to have an intersection's traffic signals turn red in every direction EXCEPT the direction the RFID tag is detected from (e.g., an ""emergency vehicle""), and we'd like that signal to be green.  But at this point, we'd just be happy with an otherwise unlit LED illuminating when the RFID module detects the tag because we're running out of time and don't have the knowledge or time to create a properly functioning intersection, or even a trio of traffic lights (red/amber/green).  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm absolutely out of my league here.  Can anyone who knows tell me if this is possible, or if it's possible but difficult to do?

If you are looking to program professionally for a company, you will still have to learn OOP as it is relatively standard, though as I will put forward not a good place to start.

  
One thing that held me back significantly is that OOP was/is the prevailing paradigm, and that is how most tutorials guide you to design your programs. This, in my humble opinion, is a huge mistake for beginners. You will be tempted to put everything inside of a box it does not really fit into. Inheritance will spaghetti your code quickly if you are a beginner. Encapsulation doesn't actually work that well, it's an attempt at abstraction but good abstractions are extremely difficult.  
What then, is the alternative? 

  
Procedural, with an emphasis on preferring functional programming over imperative.  
Procedural programming means you describe your program to the computer in terms of procedures, or operations, in a top down fashion.  Functional and imperative are two examples of procedural programming. In imperative code, you write statements to manipulate program state.  With functional programming, you encapsulate the imperative statements into functions.   
To design your program, first describe the data. The tools you have to do this are the dictionary, list, set, tuple, to name a few. The first functions then read/create/update/remove (look into building a CRUD app, for example) to your data structure, and then implement the functionality you need on top of that (such as make web requests, parse a data set, make operating system and network calls, etcetera.) 

  
Chain your functions together. For practice you can create a program with at least 10 functions, where each function can only take one argument; the data to be manipulated, or another function if you are feeling frisky! Keep your functions simple right now; try and have them perform only one operation (hint; start with reading, creating, updating and deleting from your data structure.) Have your other functions (making web requests, or what ever you'd like) call those functions whenever you need to modify your data.

One benefit to this is that the program will begin to design itself. Instead using classes for encapsulation, use modules where the main sections of your code have their own file.

I am down to write a detailed blog post with a sample program if there is interest. I also want to note that I am neither an expert nor professional programmer, I have however found myself lucky enough to be in good company with people who are that are giving me advice.

So far, when I go to the source-code, I have to CTRL-F and type in .mp3 then go one by one to make sure the file name has the name of the word that I'm trying to learn. Then I manually save the link to notepad.

That means copy and pasting many times.

So i am reading ( and displaying with a tkinter textbox )data from a serial connection but i can't process the returning data as i would like to, in order to run my tests.

Before displaying it to the textbox i would read from inside the test function  
 and then check if the response was in the read string, but now that i pass the read data(strings) to a global variable and then try to read it, it doesn't seem to work, how should i go about it?

I am working on an Automation Project in my spare time that relates to up-skilling myself. I am currently trying to create something to offload some work and generate a test script for me but I am having problems getting to where I need to be so I have turned here for some direction.

&amp;#x200B;

To begin with I have a [spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/QHFhzNg) from which I am iterating through the first column to see how many steps I have. In my example I have 12. [This works fine](https://imgur.com/lOrTzFH).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my code:

    from openpyxl import load_workbook
    
    
    def step_creator():
        filepath = ""PATHTOMYFILEtest.xlsx""
        wb = load_workbook(filepath)
        sheet = wb.active
        for cell in sheet[""A""]:
            if cell.value is None:
                raise Exception(""Cell is blank"")
            else:
                print(cell.value)
    
    run = step_creator
    run()
    
    

What I want to do next is for each row, find the value of ""D"" then do something, for example:

    Pseudocode:
    
    If step contains ""video"":
      Print(f""Step {number} is a video"")
    if step contains ""text"":
       Print (f"" Step{number} is text"")
    
    Console:
    Step 1 is a video
    Step 2 is text
    etc etc 

So in order of steps but depending on what is in ""D"" is what I want to do.

My end goal is actually to create a test case for each step type on demand which I should be able to manage I just need to get this beginning bit rolling.

Hope this makes sense, I can clarify anything if ya ask.

Here's something that I started with 

    def get_user_values(): 
       for num in range(5): 
        int(input())
    get_user_values()

The user is supposed to input a certain amount of numbers, which is why I looped the input to five. But now I want the interpreter to print out the number of how many inputs the user put. 

I tried to do it this way: 

    def get_user_values():
        num1 = int(input())
        num2 = int(input())
        num3 = int(input())
        num4 = int(input())

        num_list = len([num1, num2, num3, num4, num5])
        print(num_list)
    get_user_values()

However, I want to refrain from writing such lengthy code when I feel like it's not needed.

***output   the length of the first word and the length of the last word of the   sentence, no matter how many words are in the sentence or the length of   these words.***

* The program will one line of input.  The sentence, as a String.
* Using the **find()** method, calculate where the first word in the sentence ends. Then calculate the length of this word.
* Using the **rfind()** method, calculate where the last word in the sentence begins. Then calculate the length of this word.
* You  can assume that there are only words and spaces in the sentence  and  that there are no initial or trailing spaces or punctuation in the   sentence. Therefore, the first word begins at index 0 and the last word   ends at the end of the string.

I came up with this so far:

    senTence = str(input())
    length = len(senTence)
    
    print(""First: %d Last: %d"" % (senTence.find(''), senTence.rfind('')))

I work for a SaaS company in the implementation and services department. I serve as a consultant on functional aspects of the software. For the past 2 years I have been involved in most projects related to migrating data (usually pulled via API or read from CSV) into our platform. We have developers that write the scripts for this, but there is a lot of customer facing interaction and guiding them through configuration/cutover to our platform, etc. As we've grown it's become clear these projects are increasing in frequency, so my department has asked that I make an effort to fully own and help expand this program. Part of that plan would be moving some of the scripting workloads off of our devs. Primarily I would need to learn:  


1. Interacting with an API to read/write data
2. Interacting with CSV to read/write data
3. Manipulating data between platforms while it is in CSV

I picked up Automate the Boring Stuff and have started this (only a few chapters in) but was wondering if there are any good resources out there that are more dedicated to the above tasks? I have access to Lynda and Udemy, and I started looking on there too but figured I would ask here.

I've verified the kinematic equations to be correct. I've also set the starting guess to be the minimum angles the joints could reach.

    from datetime import datetime

    dt_obj_to_str = str(datetime.now())
    str_to_dt_obj = datetime.convert_str(dt_obj_to_str)

I'm currently using [`datetime.strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) to convert it back to a datetime object. I figured there might be a method like the pseudo code above that can easily convert a string back to a datetime object without having to specify a format code as long as the string is in a readable format.

The project I'm working on writes server information to data log file with a timestamp using [`datetime.now()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now) each time I log into a server. Part of the functionality to my program requires parsing the timestamps to get the elapsed time from when each log was created, but when I parse the timestamps from the data log file they are strings that need to be converted to datetime objects.

Here's a code snippet for reference:

    def data_log():
    	""""""Append data and timestamp to data.log file""""""
    
    	timestamp = datetime.now()
    	with open('data.log', 'a') as f:

    		elapsed_time = []
    		for timestamp in timestamps:
    			create_dt_obj = datetime.strptime(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f') 
    			elapsed_time.append(datetime.now() - create_dt_obj)

I'm a beginner at using Pandas and was wondering  what would be the best way to possible parse values from an input such as this one:

    {""event"":""create"",""on"":""operating_period"",""at"":""2019-06-01T18:17:04.086Z"",""data"":{""id"":""op_1"",""start"":""2019-06-01T18:23:04.079Z"",""finish"":""2019-06-01T18:28:04.079Z""},""organization_id"":""org-id""}
    {""event"":""register"",""on"":""vehicle"",""at"":""2019-06-01T18:17:04.088Z"",""data"":{""id"":""3a3eb23a-f22e-4fe9-8c20-f37220a81909""},""organization_id"":""org-id""}
    {""event"":""update"",""on"":""vehicle"",""at"":""2019-06-01T18:17:05.094Z"",""data"":{""id"":""bac5188f-67c6-4965-81dc-4ef49622e280"",""location"":{""lat"":52.45097,""lng"":13.46139,""at"":""2019-06-01T18:17:05.094Z""}},""organization_id"":""org-id""}

This is basically a snippet from a possible JSON data file coming from a constant stream, and the data model would be dependent upon type of event, e.g.:

    {
      ""event"": ""create"",
      ""on"": ""some_entity"",
      ""at"": ""2019-05-19T16:02:02Z"",
      ""data"": { /* ... */ },
      ""organization_id"": ""id-of-organization""
    }

The `data` key in the above structure would have other nested elements in it, such as:

    {
      ""id"":            ""s0m3-v3h1cl3-1D"",
      ""location"":      {
        ""lat"":              50.1, /* can be null if vehicle is new and no location updates were received yet */
        ""lng"":              40.2,  /* can be null if vehicle is new and no location updates were received yet */
        ""at"":               ""2016-02-02T01:00:00Z"",  /* ISO8601 format. Can be null if vehicle is new and no location updates were received yet */
      }
    }

I have tried using basic `read_json` but it seems to have issues in terms of getting data parsed due to varying columns. 

Given the context, is it possible to parse based upon `event` and/or `on` key values and then handle using a separate schema conditionally? Would a data frame be the way to go for such case or should it be parsed by JSON package first and then have dataset built conditionally from there?

Sorry if there isn't much clarification or if the question seems confusing (just like I am), and I'm basically trying to flatten structures as they come and extract certain values for computations.

hello everyone, I'm trying to learn Python by myself and i have been struggling with this exercise for the part couple of days; can anyone help me out?

Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the

user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count,

and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a

number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error

message and skip to the next number.

what i did so far is:

print(""What are your numbers?"")  
x = input()  
while True:  
print(""give me another one"")  
x = input()  
if x == 'done':  
y = 0  
for z in x:  
y = y + 1  
print(""Count: "", y)  
b = 0  
for a in (x):  
b = b + a  
print(""Total: "", b)  
c = 0

&amp;#x200B;

The challenge is to print the entire lyrics of the song ""99 bottles of beer on the wall"" with the stipulations :  
 

1. If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.
2. Besides the phrase ""take one down,"" you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
3. Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word ""bottles"" becomes singular.
4. Put a blank line between each verse of the song.

&amp;#x200B;

so far this is what I have come up with. Please let me know if I am going in the right direction? I currently get an invalid syntax error on line 4 bottles:

 

&amp;#x200B;

for i in range(0,99):

bottles = 99    

print((str(bottles) + ' bottles of beer on the wall, ' + (str(bottles) + ' bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around. ')

bottles = bottles - 1

print((str(bottles) + ' of beer on the wall.')

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thought was bottles in line 4 was invalid because I defined it outside of the for loop, but then I created it as a variable inside the loop instead. Is that an example of global variables or does that only apply to functions?

To remove unnecessary starting and trailing spaces and whitespaces around a string we can use the strip function.

 The strip function is a versatile function which can take strings as arguments too and get rid of them from a given string on either side.

87,bottledupsadness,1570296365,ddq96b,9,2,"So, I posted this problem earlier, and I did get enough suggestion on how to approach the problem; however, I still don't know how to finish it.

Here's the problem:

Write a program that first gets a list of integers from **input.** The input begins with an **integer indicating** the number of integers that follow. Then, get the **last value** from the **input**, and **output** all **integers less than or equal to that value**.

Ex: If the input is:

    5 50 60 140 200 75 100 

the output is:

    50 60 75 

The 5 indicates that there are five integers in the list, namely 50, 60, 140, 200, and 75. The 100 indicates that the program should output all integers less than or equal to 100, so the program outputs 50, 60, and 75.

Your code must define and call the following two functions:def get\_user\_values()def output\_ints\_less\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold(user\_values, upper\_threshold)

The furthest that I have gone with this problem is that I was able to print out the numbers that were to be inputted:

    def get_user_values():
        num1 = int(input())
        num2 = int(input())
        num3 = int(input())
        num4 = int(input())
        num5 = int(input())
        num6 = int(input())
        num7 = int(input())
        
    
    get_user_values()

However, I did not know how to set up conditional statements to make the program pick numbers that are less than the last inputted number.

So, I tried this way:

&amp;#x200B;

    def get_user_values(): 
    
    def output_ints_less_than_or_equal_to_threshold(user_values, upper_threshold): 
        for x in user_values: 
            if x &lt;= upper_threshold: 
                print(x)

Now, I have some sort of conditional statement to have the program output numbers that are smaller than the last number (upper\_threshold).

But, now I don't know how to set up some of the statment that tell the program to allow the user to input the numbers.

You have been tasked to construct a program that will prepare automobile liability insurance estimates for customers. The input consists of:

The name of the customer

The age of the customer

The number of traffic violations

Based on this information you will determine their status as a driver, following these guidelines:

**Number of Violations**

**Risk Code**

**Risk Type**

4 or More

1

High

3

2

Moderate

2

2

Moderate

1

3

Low

0

4

No

More than 4 tickets indicate a “Code 1” driver, which is High Risk. “Code 2” Drivers who have either 2 or 3 tickets, are considered “Moderate Risk” drivers. Any driver with one ticket is deemed “Code 3,” and considered “Low Risk.” Drivers without any tickets are considered “Code 4,” which is “No Risk.” Based upon this classification you can then give them the appropriate quote.

Pricing of Insurance:

**Age**

**Number of Tickets**

I don't know if any of you know this game, but it's called ""first to 21"".

It' s a two-player game, where a counter starts at 0, and the players take turns choosing to add 1,2 or 3 numbers to that counter and so on, at the end whichever player lands on 21 wins the game.

It's a really simple game and with playing it 4 or 5 times, you can develop a simple strategy that guarantees you win the game. You might already guess that whichever player lands on 17 also wins the game, since it doesn't matter whether the opponent chooses to add 1,2 or 3... you'll end up calling the 21 and win the game. But then you also realise that whichever player lands on 13 can also win the game, since again the opponent can pick 1,2 or 3 and at the end, you'll be the one to call 17 and therefore call 21 and win. You see the pattern? There are these checkpoints where if any of the 2 players get to them first, they're guaranteed to win the game.

If you write them, those checkpoints would be:

21,17,13,9,5,1

So basically whoever starts the game is guaranteed to win it, and the opponent can do nothing about it unless you make a mistake then he can take over and win. (provided of course, he knows the strategy)

It's a fun game that you can play at a party since it's simple and you can almost always win it no matter who challenges you. It's all fun until they figure out your strategy...

You can still win the game even if you don't start, and that is buy hoping your opponent doesn't know the plan and makes a mistake. You then take over and try to pick any of the 6 ""checkpoints"" I mentioned where you can win the game.

Anyway...

Around 2 months ago, I programmed that game in python, and I simply let the cpu choose randomly which number to add. Not fun right? It was boring and you can always win since the cpu would choose randomly. Today, I came back to that code and decided to spice things up. So I taught the program about these checkpoints and I obviously didn't put a 100% win rate for the computer since that would also be boring. I randomized which player starts (cpu or user) if the computer starts, then it wouldn't choose 1 but randomly at first, giving you a chance to win. However, if you don't take your chance wisely, the cpu shows no mercy and finishes the game with a perfect strategy.

I know my code isn't that neat nor can it be the best way to write it since I only learnt python less than 5 months ago, which is why I'm hoping if anyone has any efficient way or a better way of doing certain part that they can point it out in the comments and I learn something new.

Hope you guys like it :)

3,WeirdoDJ,1567607593,czlo4r,5,1,"Hi people,

I'm having a bit of trouble with multiprocessing/multithreading.
My end goal is to have one thread/process continually grab rows from a database, and depending on the ID contained in the row either:

* instantiate an object
* add something to the object
* push it to a queue and then start a new object. 

I've written a function which does this.

I also have to do some work on the objects in the queue, which I would like to spread out to multiple processes. 
Each object in the queue can be worked on independently. 

I expect the work to be done on the objects after they're put in the queue to take significantly longer than putting data into the queue.

I would prefer to start work on the objects in the queue while it is being filled up, as I don't know how many objects will eventually pass through - this way I avoid the data suddenly exploding in my hands.

The two latter points mean that I would prefer to have one thread/process continuously pull data from the database and do the fast work mentioned above, and have the rest of the threads/processes do the heavier work on objects from the queue.


Here are my code bits:

    #This is a private database connection package.
    from ebawsconnect.kinesis_streamer import KinesisStreamer
    import multiprocessing as mp
    import queue

    #cursor here - I have actually made this, but the query isn't relevant here.

    #An input queue where data is dumped from a grabbing function and pulled from by the workers
    iq = mp.Queue()
    #An output queue where completed work is dumped by the worker threads, so it can be written to destination
    oq = mp.Queue()

    class User:
        def __init__(self, user_id, seen_articles, iab_categories):
            self.user_id = user_id
            self.seen_articles = [seen_articles]
            self.iab_categories = iab_categories
        
        def add_article(self, article_id):
            self.seen_articles.append(article_id)

        def iab_lookup(self, article_id):
            #This will look up in either a cached dictionary or a database.
            return(iab_dummies.get(article_id))
            
        def add_iab(self):
            for article in self.seen_articles:
                self.iab_categories.append(self.iab_lookup(article))

    def datagrabber(cursor):
        user_1 = None
        current_id = None
        for _ in range(cursor.rowcount):
            temp_in = cursor.fetchone()
            if current_id != temp_in[0]:
                current_id = temp_in[0]
                if user_1 != None:
                    iq.put(user_1)
                user_1 = User(temp_in[0], temp_in[1], [])
            else:
                user_1.add_article(temp_in[1])
        iq.put(user_1)


    def worker():
        running = True
        while running == True:
            try:
                working_on = iq.get(block=True, 
                                    timeout=0.2)
                working_on.add_iab()
                #working_on.do_magic()
                oq.put(working_on)
            except queue.Empty:
                pass

As mentioned, I would like one thread/process to perform the ""datagrabber"" function, and the other threads/processes to do the ""worker"" functions.

I can't really go back and forth between pulling and working on the data, as I might have an incomplete object (i.e. the ""user-1"" might not be complete).

15,NoJudgies,1567612942,czmtl6,1,1,"Hi all,

I have a script used to automate a process on a webpage using Selenium. I'm 90% of the way there, but the final steps of the process involve browser alerts and I'm having trouble navigating those.

Here's what happens:
After clicking the button to start the process, a browser alert is created asking you to confirm you want to do this.
You click OK, and then if you aren't able to complete the process at the time, a second alert appears with the text ""undefined"". However, if your request went through successfully, no second alert appears.

I want my script to accept the first alert, and wait to see if a second alert appears with the text ""undefined"".

If the second alert appears, I want the script to print a message for the user.

This is what I have so far to close the first browser alert:

    # close first browser alert
    WebDriverWait(browser, 3).until(EC.alert_is_present)
    alert = browser.switch_to_alert()
    alert.accept()

My problem is that I receive the following error:

    line 58, in function
        WebDriverWait(browser, 3).until(EC.alert_is_present)
      File ""C:\Program Files\Python37\lib\site-packages\selenium\webdriver\support\wait.py"", line 71, 
    in until value =
        method(self._driver)
    TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

My understanding according to Selenium's documentation is that when you call WebDriverWait you need to specify the web driver and also the maximum amount of time to wait before quitting. I'm passing both of these, as browser is my webdriver object and 3 represents the amount of time in seconds to wait.

However, if I try removing the 3, I instead receive this:

    line 58, in function
        WebDriverWait(browser).until(EC.alert_is_present)
    TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'timeout'

What am I missing here? If I run with two arguments, it says I need one, if I run with one, it says I need two. I'm so confused.

        if (OCEAN = 'Shark') and (Fisher &gt; Shark):
            print('You have successfully caught the ', OCEAN)

        print('Your input is invalid /n Please choose either river or ocean')

Specific questions:

1). Is there a better way to assign Values to the fish types (ex. Shark = 5)? I was thinking there might be a good way of doing a dictionary or something, but couldn't get it to work with random. The goal is to maybe have like 50 different fish with many having the same values... I found that this code doesn't work:

    Bluegill, Carp, Crappie = 3

2). Ideally I would like the random selection of 'Bluegill' to also reference a value, so that one line could be created instead of defining each fish. Something like this:

    If (OCEAN &gt; Fisher)

This code obviously doesnt work, but you see what I want to accomplish: that OCEAN pulls a random fish...such as Bluegill... and then that returns a value of 2 which is assigned to it.

I recently began learning to code and have some basic python knowledge. I have been trying to solve some of the questions on CodeSignal - specifically the ""Arcade"" questions of which there are 60 at the beginner level. I have been having a very difficult time figuring out how to solve the problem, even before I get to writing the code for a solution. I understand that there's a good amount I need to learn to be able to code the solution correctly, and I have been using google and stack overflow to help me figure out things often.

However, my issue lately has been even \*before\* getting to the coding part - it's figuring out the algorithm on pen and paper to solve the question presented. And I feel very stuck since there's no way I can begin coding (I don't want to code blindly) before I even understand what steps would be involved in solving the problem.

So, my question is - **is there any way to get better at thinking through a question or situation? How did you get better at it, and better at creating appropriate algorithms in general? I** feel pretty helpless right now since I know things will get better with practice and come more easily, but I'm struggling to even get more practice because I'm unable to solve these problems from the get-go. I was recommended the textbook ""The Algorithm Design Manual"", and wasn't sure if starting t to delve into that would be helpful?

I have a background in biology/medicine and intend to attend a coding bootcamp in coming months, but I'd like to be able to improve and sharpen my skills and thought process in the meantime, so any help would be truly appreciated. Thank you!

The `class Loop` is inheriting `class Inpt` and `class Inpt` is being initialized on it , but it still says `a` is not defined. isn't the whole point of inheritance to use everything from 1 class into another?

How can i make the object attribute ``a` of `class Inpt` be used by `class Loop`? 

If use a self.a it doesn't change anything, just tested to be sure.

##Question 2: Class execution and code order.

This is an issue of making multiple classes work in order:

            class SomeLoop():
                while True:
                    input(""Input something again:"")

            class Filler_Class():
                pass

            class Filler_Class2():
                pass

            class Filler_Class3():
                pass


            class Start(SomeLoop, Filler_Class, Filler_Class2, Filler_Class3):

                def __init__():
                    SomeLoop.__init__(self)
                    Filler_Class.__init__(self)
                    Filler_Class2.__init__(self)
                    Filler_Class3.__init__(self)

                Text=""""

                while Text=="""":
                    print(""This is the start of the script."")
                    input(""Input something:"")

Here the while on `SomeLoop` will initialize first (even if the input suggest it should be the second one) and that makes sense because `class Start` is inheriting the other classes AND initializing them before the while within it.

But if change the order of `class Start` to initialize AFTER the while loop like this:

            class Start(SomeLoop, Filler_Class, Filler_Class2, Filler_Class3):

                Text=""""

                while Text=="""":
                    print(""This is the start of the script."")
                    input(""Input something:"")

                def __init__():
                    SomeLoop.__init__(self)
                    Filler_Class.__init__(self)
                    Filler_Class2.__init__(self)
                    Filler_Class3.__init__(self)

`SomeLoop` while loop still initializes first.

It has no reason to do so, but it does.

If i try to copy `class Start` before `class SomeLoop` it will give an error because i would be initializing classes that do not exist yet!

The script writting is ""upside down"" but the execution will begin on the from the top. How do i fix this conflict without alter the while loop conditions?

Am i writing a code in a wrong order?

&amp;nbsp;

##Question 3: `if __name__==""__main__""` not being optional?

I was wold this conditional was good manners to use, but never obligatory (though i still can't think in a realistic scenario where i would need to write it, all the examples of this i have seen trigger it on purpose, in a real code i don't see a need for this but that's irrelevant) however, when i am using unittest, it seems to be obligatory:

In a file called `capitalize.py`:

            def cap_text(text):
                return text.title()     #This will return the first letter of the first word in upper case.

Using unitest in another file, importing `capitalize.py`:

            import unittest
            import capitalize

            class capital(unittest.TestCase):

                def test_one_word(self):    
                    text = 'python'
                    result = capitalize.cap_text(text)
                    self.assertEqual(result, 'Python')              #No error here.

                def test_multiple_word(self): 
                    text = 'monty python'
                    result = capitalize.cap_text(text)           
                    self.assertEqual(result, 'Monty Python')     #This will give an error since only the first word first letter 
                                                                                # will be in upper case.

If i delete the if condition in the end and indent the unittest.main() (why main anyway?) to the left where it should be if there is no conditional, it doesn't work.

It will do a test, but not find any error.

        OK

25,Soslan,1567623908,czp9g2,4,1,"I'm going to try summarizing my problem as best I can.   


I'd like to write a program that tracks certain items; let's say cell phones. Some number of people are trusting their phones to a custodian, who is responsible for charging the phone and returning it. Each phone is identified by a unique number, which is assigned the first time someone brings their phone to the custodian. Some data about the phone is recorded while it's with the custodian, say the name of the owner, the phone brand and model (Galaxy S8/iPhone X/Etc), the charger type (micro usb/USB-C/etc) and the amount of time it took the phone to reach a full charge.   


My question is, what data structure would I use to store that information?  A second question is, if I don't know when writing the program how many phones will be turned in to begin with, how would I address that? I know I could just create an arbitrarily large number of phone objects, and have the data for a particular phone assigned to the corresponding object: phone1, phone2, phone3, etc. so long as no two phones are ever assigned the same identifier.

Most of my projects thus far have been one off scripts that do exactly 1 thing. I'm now working a little program that will connect create a connection instance to a fairly finicky API and then be available do some work (long list of methods). The basic structure is like this: 

    class store_session(storeid): #store ID from list of stores
        # gets session token
        # tracks session expiration time
        # leaky-bucket tracker # when to pump the brakes on the request rate
        
        #possible method types:
        refresh token()
        
        #Reporting methods - could be broken down into customers, orders, taxes, inventory, etc 
        reporting method1(): # A long list of possible GET endpoints and code to parse the responses
        reporting method2()....
    
        editing methods (): # updating data on the server 
    
        #Other API's - sending data to other api's 
        facebook offline transactions
        google retargeting 
        ...etc 
    
        #database methods 
        insert_data()
        select_data()
        ... etc

I think I have my head wrapped around the mechanics of using classes, but I haven't yet come across guidance on how to organize classes. In this case, I can see that I should absolutely break this project up into multiple classes that inherit from the main class and possibly each other, but I'm looking for feedback on where the breakpoints should be.

The output should be a string, with letters separated by ""."". Use ""999"" for punctuation and spaces. For example, encode(""Hello!"") should print out ""8.5.12.12.15.999"".

Is there any way I can ""preview"" the calendar file before importing or other ways to work around this? Also, what is the best library I should use for this kind of job?

67,aspen1135,1567658531,czw4iu,1,1,"Very new to structured logging. I've been reading the docs and I'm starting to understand the power of it. However, I am sure I am still missing a lot of information.  


I followed a basic setup that wraps a logger from the standard logging module with a few of the different built-in processors included in the structlog module. Then,  I tried logging a couple different tests.  


    import structlog
    from structlog.stdlib import *
    from structlog.processors import *
    import sys
    import logging
    
    logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, format=""%(message)s"", level=0)
    
    log = structlog.wrap_logger(
        logging.getLogger(__name__),
        processors=[
            filter_by_level,
            add_log_level,
            TimeStamper(fmt='iso'),
            JSONRenderer(indent=1, sort_keys=True),
        ]
    )
    
    log.warning('testing warning message')
    
    # prints
    &gt;&gt; {
    &gt;&gt; ""event"": ""testing warning message"",
    &gt;&gt; ""level"": ""warning"",
    &gt;&gt; ""timestamp"": ""2019-09-05T04:33:26.620082Z""
    &gt;&gt;}
    
    log.info('testing info message', some_dict={'somekey': 'value', 'other key': 'value2'})
    
    # prints
    &gt;&gt;{
    &gt;&gt; ""event"": ""testing info message"",
    &gt;&gt; ""level"": ""info"",
    &gt;&gt; ""some_dict"": {
    &gt;&gt;  ""other key"": ""value2"",
    &gt;&gt;  ""somekey"": ""value""
    &gt;&gt; },
    &gt;&gt; ""timestamp"": ""2019-09-05T04:33:26.620082Z""
    &gt;&gt;}

  
As you can see in the second log message, the timestamp processor is being sent last, even though it is only the third item in the processor chain \[\]. I want `some_dict{}` to be the last item on the chain and for other arguments to follow the log's positional argument order. Then, according to the docs- I can make my own processors and interpret select arguments to perform other actions and make my logging life a bit easier.  


Technically, I could create my own timestamp processor.

Im building the third leg of my API process and would love some input on best library/process to best fit my scenario

So the scenario is this, i have two CSV files with addresses in the following formats

**Sheet 1**

&amp;#x200B;

|Source|Display\_Address|Unit|Street\_Number|Street\_Name|Suburb|Postcode|State|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

 **Sheet 2**

&amp;#x200B;

|Source|Address\_String|
|:-|:-|
|API|0/123 ABC Street, Ipswich, QLD, 4301|

What i need to do is take the Display\_Address from sheet1, and the Address\_String from sheet 2, combine them into a column in Matching\_Table and then use some sort of fuzzy logic to compare the Display\_Address and Address\_String and fill a response code into the column next to it based on its findings. for example:

Matching\_Table

|PF|23 Dundee Close, Mclaren Vale, SA, 5000|No Match|
|API|34 Manalay St, Haven, NSW, 2020|No Match|

I'm pretty sure Pandas is the best course for sorting the data and combining the two sheets, but im not sure on the best steps to do the data matching.

I did find a few github entries including FEBRL and Fuzzywuzzy etc, but im more interested in peoples opinions here on the best methodology.....

What I'm looking to do is have Salary * raise % x amount of times. I'd prefer it to print each year depending on how many has been worked. So say 5 years will give something like;

Your salary will be

This is the problem provided;

A salary calculator will let a user see how much they could earn over several years given some basic information. The calculator assumes that the user will receive a 2% raise in salary at the beginning of each following year. 
Write a Python program that will ask the user for the user’s name, the beginning salary, and how many years the person will be working. The program should check for the following values:
•	Name must be at least 1 character (i.e. not blank)
•	Beginning salary must be at least 10,000
•	Years worked must be at least 1, maximum of 10
The program should output on each line, the year and the salary. The final line should list the total salary over the lifetime of the job.",learnpython,How to print each compounding answer.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/czxp3a/how_to_print_each_compounding_answer/

82,MrMarchMellow,1567673003,czy4av,2,0,"Hey there,  
I've been following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;t=14908s) which was pretty good, but I always tend to want to change things here and there to see if I can master it, and I realize there's something missing.

So this is basically 2 files, one that establishes a class and (I think) defines a function, the other that runs the software.

here goes:

file1 : student.py

    class Student:
     def __init__(self, name, major, gpa):
         self.name = name
         self.major = major
         self.gpa = gpa

        def on_honor_roll(self):
         if self.gpa &gt;= 3.5:
             return True
        else:
             return False

file2: app.py

    from student import Student

    student1 = Student(""Jim"", ""Business"", 3.1)
student2 = Student(""Pam"", ""Art"", 3.8)

    print(student1.on_honor_roll())
    

So this is very simple. If you want to know if a student is in the Honor Roll, you type student1 or student2 in the IDE and it tells you right away based on if the gpa is at least 3.5.

However, let's say I want to give you the option to execute the code and type in the name of the student inside the console.

Something that goes like

""Insert student name to check if is on Honor Roll"", or even better ""Insert Major to know average gpa"" (this would be a next step)

I assume I ultimately will have to change the print line so that student1 is subbed by a variable? Or maybe something similar?

&amp;#x200B;

to make it extra easy I thought I'd start with the option to write directly ""student1"" or ""student2"" so I thought I'd add a ""request"" variable to use instead of ""student1"" in the code, so I did:

    request = input(""Which students would you like to evaluate? "")
print(request.on_honor_roll())


but it gives the following error:

    Which students would you like to evaluate? student1
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""C:/Users/-March-/PycharmProjects/untitled/app.py"", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
        print(request.on_honor_roll())
    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'on_honor_roll'

I suppose using a string doesn't work. I'm probably looking at it the wrong way, I should use the classes I created, but how?

&amp;#x200B;

Ideallyl I should write Jim, which is a self.name , like an attribute of a specific object in a student class. Please correct me if I'm wrong or I may have some misunderstanding.

Im teaching myself python and Im stuck at a problem that is probably very easy but I cant figure it out -  why its working the way its working.

So Ive created a text file called employees.txt and it consists of 5 lines with 5 names and their titles.

First problem:

I want to read from this file and display it in the console. I also want to print out the length of the file(store it in an array first using readlines() and then specifically calling for an element in it using readlines again only specifying an index, ex readlines()\[3\])

employee\_file = open(""employee.txt"", ""r"")  
print(len(employee\_file.readlines()))  
print(employee\_file.readlines()\[4\])

employee\_file.close()

This gives an error; saying index out of bounds. But if i run the last line ( print(employee\_file.readlines()\[4\]) ) it will work and it will show the last person in the text file, but together they dont work -  why is it that?

Second problem:

So in this I want to read and display the same file and then after that display how many elements it has; this is what im writing and what is displayed:

employee\_file = open(""employee.txt"", ""r"")  
print(employee\_file.read())  
print(len(employee\_file.readlines()))

employee\_file.close()

The output on this one is it reads out the information that is stored in the text file and then it displays '0'. But it should display 5 since there are 5 elements in it. Again, if I run the lines of code independently itll show the correct amount. 

Edit: I just tried putting the len()-line above the read and it shows the correct number of elements but it doesnt execute the read function.

20,dolphinDNA,1565017251,cmc1sl,6,1,"I'm taking a Machine Learning course on Udemy. There are about 40 sections with 301 tutorials total. I'm new to programming(Python specifically), but I'm already getting the hang of the language. I'm working on an RPG with a friend and it's super fun and going very smoothly. What I'm worried about is my rate of learning and how fast I retain information. My goal is 5 items a day . That way I finish the course in about 2 and a half months(taking weekends off. I feel like if I don't take breaks, I just zone out and get headaches.)

The way I learn is that I have to take small doses of information and repeatedly practice those small doses until I can move on to the next part. My first video I watched was a 4 hour free code camp Python video. It took me a couple weeks to finish it, but I know how to do everything the video taught and apply it to my own projects because of how I paced myself. I'm creating an RPG, I've created an Email List program, a simple four paddle style pong game, and more. Now, I can learn the Machine Learning the same way. With enough determination, repetition, practice, curiosity, etc. 

I have no doubt I can learn everything that needs to be learned about Machine Learning, but I feel like I'm very slow compared to other people who go through intense training in a small amount of time and learn everything that needs to be learned. The reason bootcamps sound so unappealing is because it's a wild amount of information in under a year. Sorry if this could of been shorter, but now on to the main question, does this matter to employers or is all they care about that you can do the job correctly? I'm logging my learning hours in an excel sheet and it looks embarrassing. 5 hours a day completing 5 tutorials a day, some days all I did was 3 hours. Some days I complete 7 tutorials if they aren't as long. I have other things I put time into as well like my current job, projects I'm working on with friends (which include practicing Python)  


Am I overthinking? I'm I doing fine? Will I be doomed and left behind while genius fast retaining programmers take the good jobs?

So I create a workbook, (calling the xlsxwriter object with the workbook method and name it 'loop.xlsx. I then add a sheet by calling the workbook object's 'add\_worksheet' method.

so, on line 58 we have an elif branch for column 6 where I have:

So when it exits the elif branch, it should write the cell using that format option.

Here is what I am doing:

Collecting a series of IDs from the user. The ID is valid if it ends with a '@'. If it is valid, add it to a list, if it's not valid, ask the user to correct it. When the user signals that they are done, by type '-d', the program will list out the IDs entered to ensure that the user entered all of them.

    QUIT = ""-d""

    quit_mess = "" 1 ""

for member in team_list:
        print(member)

So I've been exposed a little to python through Touchdesigner, using it for Touchdesigner specific stuff, but I'm getting to the point where I'm no longer afraid to really dive in and learn the language. 

Lately I've been trying to meta-learn (or learn how to learn) and looking into learning as a hierarchy, as in beginning from the big picture down to the smallest details and working your way back up, and finding for me this is the best way to quickly grasp a complex system. 

Python seems to naturally include deep levels of abstraction, but all the beginner resources I'm seeing seem to start with the hello world example and approach it from the textbook method of start with presenting the smallest details 1 by 1 (there's a reason no one's ever read a textbook by choice). I'm trying to understand the grammar function of things like decorators and the double underscore thing but they just go into lengthy, convoluted examples that don't explain how the concepts relate to each other. 

I was hoping someone could present me with a hierarchy or fractal of concepts that explains the whole of python (well as much as possible) as it boils down to a few mutually exclusive concepts. I know there's classes, functions, and objects, but I'm not sure how they relate, who inherits from who, etc. Props if it can be in the form of a drawing!

**Every single time, the queue has nothing that is appended to it. The length is 0. I don't see why this shouldn't work?**

The place where I noticed this was an issue was because this function turned up an error that I was popping on an empty list:

        toc = time.time()

Dequeue function it's using:

    def dequeue(queue):
            queue.pop(0)

That didn't make any sense, so I looked into my enqueue function and obviously turns out it doesn't seem to be working. For reference if it helps, it is reading from a file and that is where the information is coming from:

    def read_file():

* Store each column of the dataset in different list.
* Convert Columns 1-4 to floats.

Consider the following operation - we take a positive integer n  
and replace it with the sum of its prime factors (if a prime number is presented multiple times in the factorization of n  
, then it's counted the same number of times in the sum). This operation is applied sequentially first to the given number, then to the first result, then to the second result and so on, until the result remains the same.

Given any number, find the final result of the operation.

**Example**

* For n = 24  
, the output should be factorSum(n) = 5  
.  
24 -&gt; (2 + 2 + 2 + 3) = 9 -&gt; (3 + 3) = 6 -&gt; (2 + 3) = 5 -&gt; 5  
.  
So the answer for n = 24  
 is 5

Overall, my aim is to be able to do what I do currently in SAS and SQL with Python -- ETL, data analysis, reporting, visualisation, automation of most code. 

The reason for this is because I see the industry is moving away from SAS - since it is very expensive, and also the move to cloud architecture.

If anyone else has been in a similar path of transitioning / expanding from SAS to Python -- could you please tell me your story -- the path you took, the lessons learnt, mistakes to avoid, and also the study material/resources you consider were a major contribution in your learning process.

I have sensor data program that is writing it's data onto a CSV file. It can sample up to 60 samples/second. But for the sake of this demonstration, I have my CSV file sampling at 15 samples/second.

Here's the [CSV data](https://send.firefox.com/download/499762bf0b9f5daa/#i1DXqR0nXzcR1YUwBO2jMQ).

My attempt:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.animation as animation
    import matplotlib.dates as matdate
    from matplotlib import style
    import time
    import datetime as dt
    import csv
    from matplotlib import style
    
    style.use('bmh')
    
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    
    def animate(i):
        csvfile = open('AlmostTimeToGo1.csv', 'r')
        file = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter = ',')
        # next(file, None)
        # next(file, None)
        # next(file, None)
    
        x = []
        y1 = []
        y2 = []
        y3 = []
    
        for column in file:
            x.append((column[0]))
            y1.append(column[1])
            y2.append((column[2]))
            y3.append((column[3]))
    
            ax.clear()
            ax.plot(x, y1, y2, y3)
    ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, interval=1000)
    
    plt.show()

And my UGLY figure look like [this](https://imgur.com/a/zkstfgJ). Even when my sensor data program isn't running and not writing anymore data onto the CSV, my plotter program is still having difficulty. What other way would there be to set it up?

I have this helper function:

    def find_index(cat, col, header):
        if col.value == header:
            return col.column - 1
        else:
            return cat

I initiatialize the variables that store the text I'll be looking for:

    h1 = h2 = h3 = h4 = h4 = None

Then I loop over the cells in the first row:

    for cell in wb.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=1):
        for col in cell:
            h1_index = find_index(h1, col, 'header 1')

            h5_index = find_index(h5, col, 'header 5')

The first argument is so that if it has already found the index it will continue to return it for the remaining cells.

What would be a good way of stopping looking for each index after it has been found? I could surround each one in while not but that feels a bit long winded.

2,im2Spooky4you,1562364256,c9lvh0,2,2,"A bit of background. I have three dictionaries, namely gasDict, elecDict, and waterDict. These correspond to utilities data for many residences and consist of two columns, a parsed time stamp (index) and the value of electricity, gas or water usage. Now in these dictionaries are hundreds of dataframes named according to a unique ID corresponding to a residence. The problem is that not all residences have data for all utilities and even if they do they might not have them for the same time frame. What I want to do is pick all residences that appear in all three dictionaries and create a new dictionary where I will join these separate dataframes using the timestamp as the index, returning NaN for any missing time series data. Here is the code that I have so far. 

#find common data and create list
myList = [x for x in elec_list if x in gas_list and x in water_list]
#create dictionary out of list
myDict = {elem : pd.DataFrame for elem in myList}
#loop over all keys and append data to previous #dataframe

It works fine up until the for loop where it runs very slowly (I've never seen it finish).

But pretty simply, a user will load a page, and try to search for their town on a database, if none of the options are their town, they can then go and add their town to the database.

I'm actually working in reverse for my project.  I've already created a beautiful soup script that scrapes my final page for the data I'm looking for.  Now I need to get those web pages from a search page.

From a human standpoint, the page has 3 different sections with input boxes (and 3 different search buttons).  I enter my criteria in the input boxes on the /search.cfm page and click the button.  Looking at the elements of this page, there is no ""button"" and the button they use is an image.  The input box has the same name as all the other input boxes.

Anyway it takes me to a /searchResults.cfm page when I do it manually.  I tried running the search while looking at the 'network' tab on chrome, but there's a bunch of css and I just don't know what I'm looking for.

I see references on the page to POST, so I'm hoping that it's as easy to send a post maybe using requests, but all the tuts have parameters and such that I don't know where they come from or how to find mine.  (all tuts have username/pwd and I don't have that, ha).

I've been studying Python and programming on and off since around October, and I recently realized that part of the reason I'm struggling to consistently sit down and just learn and do more stuff is because my goals surrounding this whole thing are SUPER fuzzy. So, I got to thinking: Is there a complete breakdown of what python can be used for, what those things require/need to know to be used, and their subcategories? Like fundamentals of programming and the language? I think that would help me identify areas of study a lot easier, because I think I need to narrow my sights a bit. 

I've gone to sites like W3schools and the official documentation, and they're all a wealth of knowledge, but they only really talk about how to write with the language, and don't really go into concepts, how to execute them or get started, and what you need to know. I don't know if this is making sense or not, so I'll provide an example using growing plants. This is just off the top of my head and isn't all-inclusive, of course.

    		i. Fertilization
    			&gt;process of fertilization
    		ii. Peat moss
    		iii. Tilling
    		iiii. Aeration
    
    2. Basics of planting a seed, plant, or grown plant
    	a. Location desired
    	b. Does the plant require lots of sun?
    	c. Season/timeperiod for planting this plant
    	d. Climate desired for this plant
    		i. A basic understanding of plant zones
    	e. Germination information
    
    3. Maintaining a plant
    	a. Does the plant require a lot of water? 
    	b. Does the plant have any natural predators?
    		i. If yes, how to protect the plant against these?
    	c. Is the plant annual, perennial, or bi-annual? 
    		i. If perennial, does anything special need to be done to the plant before winter? 
    
    etc.     

Does anything like this exist, except for programming, specifically with python? If so, where could I find it?

It will have some data files of the user, it has some button image file, multiple .py files, etc. I would like to my something installable, which will have its own place in program files (and program files equivalent in Linux, whatever it is).

I am in the process of learning Python and really enjoying it, which has prompted me to start planning out an app that has been in the back of my mind for a long time. But I am not as familiar with app building as much so I wanted to give an idea of what I want to do and maybe someone could point me in the general direction.

   There are multiple sources of data that I need to aggregate, hosted on different websites, provided in zipped and unzipped .csv format. Thankfully the one site with tons of different files are all in a standardized format so that’s not too big of a deal. My current Python program reaches out, grabs the required .csv, unzips it, delete the old file and renames the new one and creates a .json for parsing. The secondary files are worked over the same way.

   I am wondering if I should just dump the csv data to a database to speed things up, any recommendations for that? This csv has a header line delineating the same fields for each column, and all 1100 files have the same structure .

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to automate a task. Part of this task is to rename a bunch of pdf files and delete some parts of it. The pdfs are exclusively converted textdocuments (papers written by students) but may contain a few smaller pictures. Some of them have a scan attached on the last page, which is basically full page form. I want to delete this scanned page on every document which contains this page (not all documents do). This scanned page is a form which has been signed by each respective person which means it's quite similar but not identical. My idea was to use PyPDF2's extractText() to check each page weather it contains text and delete every page that doesn't contain any text. But extractText() does not work reliably and sometimes ends up not finding any text on a page that actually contains text. Another idea I have is would be to compare every page with the original page that has been scanned and attached with some sort of image library but I am afraid this might not work that well due to the variance in in scan-quality and dimensions (sometimes the scan was inserted badly and only fills 3/4th of the page).

I'm looking at using Pandas to do this, however I could do with some guidance on how best to approach this as I'm newish to Python and Pandas. While I've made attempts to start this, I haven't really got further than creating a dataframe from the csv file I have. 

I should point out that the data used has everything I need, however it's just rows of data and some of it I will need to be manipulated to give me percentages.... e.g. I have scores but I need to understand how to look at x amount of matches and create a percentage from that - clean sheets, over 1.5, both teams to score etc.

There's so much information out there when searching and while I'm not afraid to research, I feel that atm, I'm not finding the results I need. it may be how I'm searching because So, any tips on where I should go from that initial creation or even if Pandas is the suggested way would be appreciated :)

So, I am very new to programming! I've been working on my project which allows you to import your game library, scrape [howlongtobeat.com](https://howlongtobeat.com) in order to get the average completion times, update your library and then save it. You can also add games one by one(getting the times one by one also) or delete games. You can then save your library and choose a filename. 

The whole thing works, and I am just working on my menu for the end user (me, ahaha) and I'm very hesitant to bloat the whole thing out with if-elif statements.

&amp;#x200B;

My DESIRED code was this (SHOW, SORT, SAVE require ONE argument which is the library loaded earlier in the program):

&amp;#x200B;
    while True:
        options = {'ADD': add_game, 'DEL': del_game, 'EXIT': exit_,
                   'SHOW': display_lib, 'SORT': steam_sorter, 'SAVE': save_lib}
        for k in options.keys():
            print(k)        
        print('What would you like to do?')
        choice = input()
        options[choice]() # Obviously -- this code does not work on all keys

So, here is my terrible solution, but it works (or seems to).

    while True:
        options = {'ADD': add_game, 'DEL': del_game, 'EXIT': exit_}
        options_library = {'SHOW': display_lib, 'SORT': steam_sorter, 'SAVE': save_library}
    
            
        print('What would you like to do?')
        choice = input()
        if choice in options_library:
            options_library[choice](game_library)
        elif choice in options:
            options[choice]()

I can just sense that my solution is terrible, and there must be a better way. My experiecne thus far is going Automate The Boring Stuff (finished chapter 11 on web scraping) and then googling. So, even if the solution seems way too basic, please let me know! I really am this dense, hahaha.

I have some experience with Python, but am still relatively new. I'm interested in working with Government data ([FPDS.gov](https://FPDS.gov)) through the use of the pyFPDS wrapper. I find that the record data returned through this wrapper are difficult for me to use easily in my analysis, so am developing helper functions to return different attributes I am interested in (e.g., vendor name).

What I am finding is that many of my helper functions all look very similar. Because of this, I suspect there is a better way to approach my problem. Examples of my code are below.

My question -- can anyone recommend me a better way to develop these helper functions? I was thinking that it might make more sense to develop a single function with two inputs (fpds\_record and attribute), have the function construct a nested dictionary with all combinations of attributes, and then have the function return the proper value?

Code:

I'm failing to see why this happens. I would think that for each entry it would first check to see if it matches UK or USA, however it seems like it sees one of them in the dictionary and applies that logic to all of the rivers, countries. Why is that happening and what would be a good work around to make sure this doesn't happen in the future.

What I have done so far is if they made over 50K I assigned that data point a one if they made under a zero. I then found the total for both black and white who made over 50K and divided that by the total population and ran a z-test with the null hypothesis being 0.
